How could the accuracy of the method maybe be improved?
\begin{itemize}
    \item scale KDE function by distance 
    \item improve refraction function by including the effect of the local water surface slope
    \item incorporate the a priori confidence (i.e. KDE value strength) into the kriging estimate (well, this might have only a very marginal effect? most of the error probably comes from places where there is no icesat data at all) 
\end{itemize}

what are some weaknesses of the method?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sometimes shallow bathymetry points are missed due to culling points too close to the sea surface
    \item GEBCO nearshore accuracy is even lower outside the global north due to lack of multibeam data as an input 
\end{itemize}
