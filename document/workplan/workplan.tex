\subsection{Research Questions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item In which areas of the world will investment in mangrove restoration provide the most benefits in terms of flood risk reduction?
\end{itemize}
To answer this question, the following subquestions will be pursued:

\begin{itemize}
  \item How can global-scale data be used to improve the modeling and flood risk reduction of mangrove-lined coasts
  \item Which global hotspots identified in previous research as potentially  viable locations will provide the largest decrease in wave heights on existing infratructure
  \item Which of these hotspots will provide the largest societal return on investment in restoration of mangrove
\end{itemize}
