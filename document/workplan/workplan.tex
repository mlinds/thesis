\subsection{Research Questions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item In which areas of the world will investment in mangrove restoration provide the most benefits in terms of flood risk reduction?
\end{itemize}
To answer this question, the following subquestions will be pursued:

\begin{itemize}
  \item How can global-scale data be used to improve the accuracy of modeling of flood risk reduction due to mangrove ecosystems?
  \item Based on this modeling method, where will restoration provide the largest reduction in flood risk?
  \item Which of these hotspots will provide the largest societal return on investment in restoration of mangrove?
\end{itemize}
