## Introduction

### Motivation

### Knowledge gaps

### Research Questions

-   In which areas of the world will investment in mangrove restoration
    provide the most benefits in terms of flood risk reduction?

To answer this question, the following subquestions will be pursued:

-   How can global-scale data be used to improve the accuracy of
    modeling of flood risk reduction due to mangrove ecosystems?

-   Based on this modeling method, where will restoration provide the
    largest reduction in flood risk?

-   Which of these hotspots will provide the largest societal return on
    investment in restoration of mangrove?
