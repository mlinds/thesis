abstract = {Effective management of coastal risks demands projections of flood hazards that account for a wide variety of potential sources of uncertainty. Two typical approaches for estimating flood hazards include (1) direct physical process-based modeling of the storms themselves and (2) statistical modeling of the distributions and relevant characteristics of extreme sea level events. Recently, flexible and efficient mechanistically-motivated models for sea-level change have become widely used for characterizing uncertainty in projections of mean sea levels [Oppenheimer and Alley, 2016]. In order to complement these models for mean sea levels, there is also a need for fast and flexible estimates of extreme sea levels, and corresponding uncertainties. This is the motivating factor in the focus within the SSPipeline (Storm Surge Pipeline) project, that characterizes uncertainty in estimates of extreme sea levels, using a statistical modeling approach. Specifically, the SSPipeline project ingests and processes raw sea-level data and fits a statistical distribution to the extreme sea levels, which in turn permits estimation of the probabilities associated with these extremes.},

abstract = {Coastal flood damage and adaptation costs under 21st century sea-level rise are assessed on a global scale taking into account a wide range of uncertainties in continental topography data, population data, protection strategies, socioeconomic development and sea-level rise. Uncertainty in global mean and regional sea level was derived from four different climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, each combined with three land-ice scenarios based on the published range of contributions from ice sheets and glaciers. Without adaptation, 0.2–4.6{\%} of global population is expected to be flooded annually in 2100 under 25–123 cm of global mean sea-level rise, with expected annual losses of 0.3–9.3{\%} of global gross domestic product. Damages of this magnitude are very unlikely to be tolerated by society and adaptation will be widespread. The global costs of protecting the coast with dikes are significant with annual investment and maintenance costs of US{\$} 12–71 billion in 2100, but much smaller than the global cost of avoided damages even without accounting for indirect costs of damage to regional production supply. Flood damages by the end of this century are much more sensitive to the applied protection strategy than to variations in climate and socioeconomic scenarios as well as in physical data sources (topography and climate model). Our results emphasize the central role of long-term coastal adaptation strategies. These should also take into account that protecting large parts of the developed coast increases the risk of catastrophic consequences in the case of defense failure.},

abstract = {Bayesian Networks (BNs) are graphical models which allow the representation of a probability distribution over more than one variable. They provide an elegant way of describing how variables depend on each other. Our main goal for this course is that it serves participants as a guide to main concepts and important issues that need to be taken into account when using BNs as modelling tool. Additionally, software applications (some developed within TNO) and their basic operation will be discussed. The audience of the course may include participants with no previous experience with BNs. However some familiarity with modelling in general is required and familiarity with basic probability theory is desirable. In this course we focus on BNs that model the uncertainty about the state of physical systems. However, the concepts to be discussed are general and independent of the field of application. Thus they also hold for applications of BNs in different domains, for example behavioural and cognitive sciences or health related applications to name a couple. The scope of BN applications within TNO is also not restricted to physical systems. As examples of the type of applications carried out within TNO we briefly mention two different types of applications in Appendix A. The first is a set of applications that are aimed at performance measurement of complex systems under various operational circumstances. The second type of BN application is in the area of police investigation and military intelligence. The scope of applications of BNs outside TNO is even broader (for an overview see Weber 2012 et al.). We do not aim to be exhaustive in Appendix A, but merely provide an idea of the type of applications carried out within TNO, outside the examples presented in this document.},

abstract = {Due to the remote location and the extreme climate, monitoring stations in Arctic rivers such as Lena in Siberia have been decreasing through time. Every year, after a long harsh winter, the accumulated snow on the Lena watershed melts, leading to the major annual spring flood event causing heavy transport of sediments, organic carbon, and trace metals, both into as well as within the delta. This study aims to analyze the hydrodynamic processes of the spring flood taking place every year in the Lena Delta. Thus, a combination of remote sensing techniques and hydrodynamic modeling methodologies is used to overcome limitations caused by missing ground-truth data. As a test site for this feasibility study, the outlet of the Lena River to its delta was selected. Lena Delta is an extensive wetland spanning from northeast Siberia into the Arctic Ocean. Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of the TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X satellite mission served as input for the hydrodynamic modeling software HEC-RAS. The model resulted in inundation areas, flood depths, and flow velocities. The model accuracy assessed by comparing the multi-temporal modeled inundation areas with the satellite-derived inundation areas ranged between 65 and 95{\%}, with kappa coefficients ranging between 0.78 and 0.97, showing moderate to almost perfect levels of agreement between the two inundation boundaries. Modeling results of high flow discharges show a better agreement with the satellite-derived inundation areas compared to that of lower flow discharges. Overall, the remote-sensing-based hydrodynamic modeling succeeded in indicating the increase and decrease in the inundation areas, flood depths, and flow velocities during the annual flood events.},

abstract = {Use of mangrove ecosystems for coastal flood protection requires reliable predictions of mangrove wave attenuation, especially if this capacity lessens due to storm-induced forest damage. Quantifying and understanding the variation in drag forces and mechanical properties of mangrove vegetation can improve assessment of mangrove protective capacity. We studied five mangrove species common in the subtropical Pearl River Delta, south China. The studied species range from typically landward-occurring to more seaward-occurring pioneer species. We sampled across seven sites in the delta to study the impact of salinity on mechanical properties. We quantified strength and flexibility of branches (branch strength and flexibility related to branch diameter, modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity), leaf strength (leaf attachment strength related to leaf size, and leaf mass per area) and drag properties (drag force related to surface area and drag coefficient). For all tested species, larger branch diameters resulted in higher mechanical strength. Larger leaf size resulted in larger peak pulling forces and larger branch surface area resulted in stronger drag forces. Notably, species that generally occur lower in the intertidal zone, where exposure to wind and waves is higher, had relatively stronger branches but more easily detachable leaves. This may be regarded as a damage-avoiding strategy. Across the seven field sites, we found no clear effect of salinity on mangrove mechanical properties. This study provides a mechanistic insight in the storm damage process for individual mangrove trees and a solid base for modeling storm (surge) damage at the forest scale.},

abstract = {The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission used laser altimetry measurements to determine changes in elevations of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as sea ice thickness distribution. These measurements have provided important information on the response of the cryopshere (Earth's frozen surfaces) to changes in atmosphere and ocean condition. ICESat operated from 2003 to 2009 and provided repeat altimetry measurements not only to the cryosphere scientific community but also to the ocean, terrestrial and atmospheric scientific communities. The conclusive assessment of significant ongoing rapid changes in the Earth's ice cover, in part supported by ICESat observations, has strengthened the need for sustained, high accuracy, repeat observations similar to what was provided by the ICESat mission. Following recommendations from the National Research Council for an ICESat follow-on mission, the ICESat-2 mission is now under development for planned launch in 2018. The primary scientific aims of the ICESat-2 mission are to continue measurements of sea ice freeboard and ice sheet elevation to determine their changes at scales from outlet glaciers to the entire ice sheet, and from 10s of meters to the entire polar oceans for sea ice freeboard. ICESat carried a single beam profiling laser altimeter that produced {\~{}} 70 m diameter footprints on the surface of the Earth at {\~{}} 150 m along-track intervals. In contrast, ICESat-2 will operate with three pairs of beams, each pair separated by about 3 km cross-track with a pair spacing of 90 m. Each of the beams will have a nominal 17 m diameter footprint with an along-track sampling interval of 0.7 m. The differences in the ICESat-2 measurement concept are a result of overcoming some limitations associated with the approach used in the ICESat mission. The beam pair configuration of ICESat-2 allows for the determination of local cross-track slope, a significant factor in measuring elevation change for the outlet glaciers surrounding the Greenland and Antarctica coasts. The multiple beam pairs also provide improved spatial coverage. The dense spatial sampling eliminates along-track measurement gaps, and the small footprint diameter is especially useful for sea surface height measurements in the often narrow leads needed for sea ice freeboard and ice thickness retrievals. The ICESat-2 instrumentation concept uses a low energy 532 nm (green) laser in conjunction with single-photon sensitive detectors to measure range. Combining ICESat-2 data with altimetry data collected since the start of the ICESat mission in 2003, such as Operation IceBridge and ESA's CryoSat-2, will yield a 15 + year record of changes in ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness. ICESat-2 will also provide information of mountain glacier and ice cap elevations changes, land and vegetation heights, inland water elevations, sea surface heights, and cloud layering and optical thickness.},

abstract = {Technical advancements have widened the limits of remote sensing in mapping shallow water benthic habitats and bathymetry over the last decades. On the other hand, the needs of shallow water remote sensing have pushed instrument development. In this manuscript we provide 50-year retrospective of the developments in the field in terms of both instrumentation and methods. We also show that spectral features characteristic of the main benthic groups in shallow water are consistent from the tropics to sub-arctic regions and from salty to freshwaters. The fundamental limiting factor in both benthic mapping and bathymetry is absorption of light by water molecules. However, spectral absorption by water molecules is the key to bathymetry derivation. Variable backscattering by particles and absorption by dissolved organic matter is a confounding factor for all objectives. The combination of using the spectral and textural characteristics of bottom features and our knowledge about these features have now resulted in the ability to map habitats over large coastal systems. This manuscript has shown that optically shallow water remote sensing has reached levels where the satellite derived bathymetry and habitat maps are accepted by different end users (including the International Maritime Organisation) and are routinely used in ecological studies, monitoring and management of coastal environments.},

abstract = {Many low-elevation, coral reef-lined, tropical coasts are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, sea level rise, and wave-induced flooding. The considerable morphological diversity of these coasts and the variability of the hydrodynamic forcing that they are exposed to make predicting wave-induced flooding a challenge. A process-based wave-resolving hydrodynamic model (XBeach Non-Hydrostatic, “XBNH”) was used to create a large synthetic database for use in a “Bayesian Estimator for Wave Attack in Reef Environments” (BEWARE), relating incident hydrodynamics and coral reef geomorphology to coastal flooding hazards on reef-lined coasts. Building on previous work, BEWARE improves system understanding of reef hydrodynamics by examining the intrinsic reef and extrinsic forcing factors controlling runup and flooding on reef-lined coasts. The Bayesian estimator has high predictive skill for the XBNH model outputs that are flooding indicators, and was validated for a number of available field cases. It was found that, in order to accurately predict flooding hazards, water depth over the reef flat, incident wave conditions, and reef flat width are the most essential factors, whereas other factors such as beach slope and bed friction due to the presence or absence of corals are less important. BEWARE is a potentially powerful tool for use in early warning systems or risk assessment studies, and can be used to make projections about how wave-induced flooding on coral reef-lined coasts may change due to climate change.},

abstract = {Analyses of land area and population distribution in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) and their potential susceptibility to future sea level rise have been used to derive first-order assessments of areas and populations at risk. Variations in results are shown to be highly dependent on the input datasets. In this paper we explore differences in land and population distribution estimates in the LECZ resulting from the use of three digital elevation models and two population datasets at global, continent, and country levels. Results at the global scale show differences of up to 150{\%} in area estimates, depending on the elevation model used. The differences are most extreme below 1 m elevation and diminish at higher elevation increments. On the continent level, the use of different elevation models produced area estimate differences ranging from more than 1200{\%} at an elevation of 1 m to 160{\%} in the LECZ. Country-level differences are even higher. Similarly, substantial differences in population distribution can arise with the use of different population datasets. Population counts below 1 m elevation range from 1{\%} to 2.3{\%} of the total global population. In the LECZ, estimates vary from 9.2{\%} to 10.9{\%} of the total global population. Differences at continental and country levels are also significant depending on the elevation model and the population dataset used. These large differences indicate that results of such analyses should be regarded with caution and within the context of the methods and materials used.},

I find Smith and Sandwell's (1997) global sea floor topography relatively accurate for peak geoposition but generally deeper than multibeam by 192 m (±132 m). Cell size alone can explain 50-90{\%} of peak height variation, suggesting higher-resolution geodetic altimetry could improve the accuracy of these estimates. Nevertheless, midsection areas overlap by 80 ± 11{\%}. The altimetric technique clearly resolves the presence and general form of numerous unnamed deep seamounts, though predicted seamount peak height estimates for small features may vary from their true depth by up to 50{\%}. These findings support high-end estimates of global seamount abundance since small seamount features (∼1200 m relief) revealed by satellite may, in actuality, be quite substantial features (∼2500 m relief).

abstract = {This study provides the first assessment of decadal changes in mangrove extents in Sierra Leone. While significant advances have been made in mangrove mapping using remote sensing, no study has documented long-term changes in mangrove extents in Sierra Leone—one of the most vulnerable countries in West Africa. Such understanding is critical for devising regional management strategies that can support local livelihoods. We utilize multi-date Landsat data and cloud computational techniques to quantify spatiotemporal changes in land cover, with focus on mangrove ecosystems, for 1990–2016 along the coast of Sierra Leone. We specifically focus on four estuaries—Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Yawri Bay, and Sherbro. We relied on the k-means approach for an unsupervised classification, and validated the classified map from 2016 using ground truth data collected from Sentinel-2 and high-resolution images and during field research (accuracy: 95{\%}). Our findings indicate that the Scarcies river estuary witnessed the greatest mangrove loss since 1990 (45{\%}), while the Sierra Leone river estuary experienced mangrove gain over the last 26 years (22{\%}). Overall, the Sierra Leone coast lost 25{\%} of its mangroves between 1990 and 2016, with the lowest coverage in 2000, during the period of civil war (1991–2002). However, natural mangrove dynamics, as supported by field observations, indicate the potential for regeneration and sustainability under carefully constructed management strategies.},

abstract = {This paper describes the impacts of sea surface temperature (SST) rise and sea-level rise (SLR) on cyclonic storm surge flooding in western Bangladesh. A calibrated numerical hydrodynamic model was used to simulate surge wave propagation through the rivers and overland flooding. The model was calibrated with base condition (present climate), and then eight flooding scenarios of plausible future conditions were assessed by considering increased surge heights. Flooded area, flooding depth and surge intrusion length were computed by superimposing the predicted maximum water level information on a digital elevation model (DEM). This analysis showed that for a storm surge under 2 °C SST rise and 0.3 m SLR, flood risk area would be 15.3{\%} greater than the present risk area and depth of flooding would increase by as much as 22.7{\%} within 20 km from the coastline. Within the risk area, the study identified 5690 km2 land (22{\%} of exposed coast) as a high-risk zone (HRZ) where flooding of depth 1 m or more might occur, and people should move to nearby cyclone shelters during extreme cyclonic events. Predicted area of HRZ is 1.26 times the currently demarcated HRZ. It was estimated that 320 additional shelters are required to accommodate people in the newly identified HRZ. This information would be of value to policy and decision makers for future shelter planning and designing shelter heights. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Mangrove forest ecosystems are distributed at the land-sea interface in tropical and subtropical regions and play an important role in carbon cycles and biodiversity. Accurately mapping global mangrove aboveground biomass (AGB) will help us understand how mangrove ecosystems are affected by the impacts of climatic change and human activities. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) techniques have been proven to accurately capture the three-dimensional structure of mangroves and LiDAR can estimate forest AGB with high accuracy. In this study, we produced a global mangrove forest AGB map for 2004 at a 250-m resolution by combining ground inventory data, spaceborne LiDAR, optical imagery, climate surfaces, and topographic data with random forest, a machine learning method. From the published literature and free-access datasets of mangrove biomass, we selected 342 surface observations to train and validate the mangrove AGB estimation model. Our global mangrove AGB map showed that average global mangrove AGB density was 115.23 Mg/ha, with a standard deviation of 48.89 Mg/ha. Total global AGB storage within mangrove forests was 1.52 Pg. Cross-validation with observed data demonstrated that our mangrove AGB estimates were reliable. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 0.48 and 75.85 Mg/ha, respectively. Our estimated global mangrove AGB storage was similar to that predicted by previous remote sensing methods, and remote sensing approaches can overcome overestimates from climate-based models. This new biomass map provides information that can help us understand the global mangrove distribution, while also serving as a baseline to monitor trends in global mangrove biomass.},

abstract = {Although Northern Europe has been the target area in many regionwide geoid determination studies, the research has been land-focused, neglecting bathymetry information. With new projects, such as the Baltic Sea Chart Datum 2000, the attention is shifting toward the marine geoid. Hence, consideration for bathymetry has become relevant, the influence of which is studied. In the relatively shallow Baltic Sea, accounting for bathymetry-based residual terrain model reduction during gravity data processing induces marine geoid modeling differences (relative to neglecting bathymetry) mainly within 2 cm. However, the models can deviate up to 3{\&}ndash;4 cm in some regions. Rugged Norwegian coastal areas, on the other hand, had modeling improvements around a decimeter. Considering bathymetry may thus help improve geoid modeling outcomes in future Northern Europe geoid determination projects. Besides using the conventional precise GNSS-leveling control points, the paper also demonstrates the usefulness of shipborne GNSS and airborne laser scanning-derived geoidal heights in validating geoid modeling results. A total of 70 gravimetric geoid solutions are presented, for instance, by varying the used reference global geopotential models. According to the comparisons, GOCO05c-based solutions generally perform the best, where modeling agreement with GNSS-leveling control points reached 2.9 cm (standard deviation) from a one-dimensional fit.},

abstract = {The statistics of extremes have played an important role in engineering practice for water resources design and management. How recent developments in the statistical theory of extreme values can be applied to improve the rigor of hydrologic applications and to make such analyses more physically meaningful is the central theme of this paper. Such methodological developments primarily relate to maximum likelihood estimation in the presence of covariates, in combination with either the block maxima or peaks over threshold approaches. Topics that are treated include trends in hydrologic extremes, with the anticipated intensification of the hydrologic cycle as part of global climate change. In an attempt to link downscaling (i.e., relating large-scale atmosphere-ocean circulation to smaller-scale hydrologic variables) with the statistics of extremes, statistical downscaling of hydrologic extremes is considered. Future challenges are reviewed, such as the development of more rigorous statistical methodology for regional analysis of extremes, as well as the extension of Bayesian methods to more fully quantify uncertainty in extremal estimation. Examples include precipitation and streamflow extremes, as well as economic damage associated with such extreme events, with consideration of trends and dependence on patterns in atmosphere-ocean circulation (e.g., El Ni{\~{n}}o phenomenon). {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Mcivor2012,
abstract = {Storm surges occur when high winds and low atmospheric pressure raise water levels at the coast, causing sea water to surge onto the land. They are a major threat to low-lying coastal areas and their inhabitants. The largest storm surges are caused by tropical cyclones (also called hurricanes and typhoons in different regions); peak water levels can exceed 7 m in height, and can result in extensive flooding, loss of life and damage to property. Global climate change may result in increased storm surge flooding in some areas, through intensification of the cyclones driving the storm surges and as a result of sea level rise. Mangroves can reduce storm surge water levels by slowing the flow of water and reducing surface waves. Therefore mangroves can potentially play a role in coastal defence and disaster risk reduction, either alone or alongside other risk reduction measures such as early warning systems and engineered coastal defence structures (e.g. sea walls). Measured rates of storm surge reduction through mangroves range from 5 to 50 centimetres water level reduction per kilometre of mangrove width. In addition, surface wind waves are expected to be reduced by more than 75{\%} over one kilometre of mangroves. Few data are available on surge reduction rates through mangroves because of the difficulties associated with measuring water levels during storm surges. All data currently available are from the south-eastern United States, where networks of recorders have been placed in wetland areas. Numerical models and simulations, validated using this data, provide the only means of exploring the importance of different factors in reducing storm surge heights. The numerical model of Zhang et al. (2012; Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 102: 11-23) suggests that mangroves are more effective at reducing the water levels of fast moving surges than those of slow moving surges. The model also indicates that water level reduction through mangroves is non-linear, with the greatest reduction in surge height occurring near the seaward edge of the mangroves. Seaward of mangroves, a bulge of water can form as the water piles up in front of the mangroves; this can increase storm surge levels in this area. Several topics relating to storm surge reduction by mangroves are yet to be explored, such as the effect of mangrove density, species composition and vegetative morphology. Dense mangrove forests, including species with aerial roots, are expected to increase storm surge reduction rates. By reducing water levels and wave energy, mangroves can save lives and reduce storm-surge related damage to infrastructure: during a typhoon in north-east India, mangroves reduced the number of lives lost, as well as reducing damage to houses, crops and possibly coastal defence structures. Mangroves can also help people recover after coastal disasters by providing firewood, building materials and food sources (e.g. fish and shellfish that live among mangrove aerial roots). Cyclones and storm surges also impact mangroves themselves; some trees may be defoliated or uprooted. Extreme events with very high water levels and wind speeds may severely damage or destroy mangrove areas, rendering them less effective at reducing surge heights. Natural recovery can take many years to decades; restoration projects may speed up recovery. Further data on storm surge reduction by mangroves and further refinements to numerical models and simulations will improve our ability to understand and quantify the coastal defence services provided by mangrove forests against storm surges. Such information is needed to ensure that the coastal defence functions of mangroves are utilised appropriately, either alone or in combination with other measures, to reduce risk to people and infrastructure from storm surges.},

abstract = {Low-lying tropical islands are highly vulnerable to the effects of sea-level rise and climate change. Most pressing is the threat posed to their fresh water supplies by wave-induced flooding. This thesis attempts to generalize previous site-specific studies of flooding on coral atolls and apply it in a framework that can be used for early warning systems or long-term climate change impact studies. To do so, a large synthetic database of representative reef properties and hydrodynamics was developed using the numerical wave model XBeach, and then analyzed using a Bayesian probabilistic network. The resulting tool allows us to make real-time flood predictions based on offshore wave or sea level conditions, and the unique characteristics of a given island (e.g. topography). Narrow, smooth reefs with steep fore reef slopes are the most vulnerable to runup. Extreme flooding is associated with anomalously high, resonant low frequency waves, which are more likely to occur on narrow, smooth reefs subjected to extreme swell waves (large wave heights with long periods). These extreme swells are "blue sky" events which originate from distant storms. Thus, they may thus arrive without warning, since they are completely independent of local weather conditions. This bolsters the need for more effective prediction tools. Validation of the results presented in this study is limited by the small number of field observations against which the model can be compared. Thus, there is a need to develop a comprehensive database of reef morphology and hydrodynamics. Offshore wave conditions, water levels, and reef width are the most essential variables for predicting runup, so future research efforts should be directed towards collecting those data. This model can also be used to ask questions like, "which islands will be most severely impacted by climate change?", or "can we increase flood resilience for a given island by restoring its coral reefs?". Hence, there is also potential for its use in guiding decision-makers to allocate limited funding in the places where it will have the most impact.},

@article{Alongi2008,
abstract = {This review assesses the degree of resilience of mangrove forests to large, infrequent disturbance (tsunamis) and their role in coastal protection, and to chronic disturbance events (climate change) and the future of mangroves in the face of global change. From a geological perspective, mangroves come and go at considerable speed with the current distribution of forests a legacy of the Holocene, having undergone almost chronic disturbance as a result of fluctuations in sea-level. Mangroves have demonstrated considerable resilience over timescales commensurate with shoreline evolution. This notion is supported by evidence that soil accretion rates in mangrove forests are currently keeping pace with mean sea-level rise. Further support for their resilience comes from patterns of recovery from natural disturbances (storms, hurricanes) which coupled with key life history traits, suggest pioneer-phase characteristics. Stand composition and forest structure are the result of a complex interplay of physiological tolerances and competitive interactions leading to a mosaic of interrupted or arrested succession sequences, in response to physical/chemical gradients and landform changes. The extent to which some or all of these factors come into play depends on the frequency, intensity, size, and duration of the disturbance. Mangroves may in certain circumstances offer limited protection from tsunamis; some models using realistic forest variables suggest significant reduction in tsunami wave flow pressure for forests at least 100 m in width. The magnitude of energy absorption strongly depends on tree density, stem and root diameter, shore slope, bathymetry, spectral characteristics of incident waves, and tidal stage upon entering the forest. The ultimate disturbance, climate change, may lead to a maximum global loss of 10–15{\%} of mangrove forest, but must be considered of secondary importance compared with current average annual rates of 1–2{\%} deforestation. A large reservoir of below-ground nutrients, rapid rates of nutrient flux and microbial decomposition, complex and highly efficient biotic controls, self-design and redundancy of keystone species, and numerous feedbacks, all contribute to mangrove resilience to various types of disturbance.},

abstract = {Adaptation planning for flood risk forms a significant part of global climate change response. Engineering responses to higher water levels can be prohibitively costly. Several recent studies emphasize the potential role of ecosystems in flood protection as adaptive risk reduction measures while also contributing to carbon fixation. Here, we use a conceptual model study to illustrate the built-in adaptive capability of ecosystems to reduce a wide range of wave heights, occurring at different water levels, to a narrower range. Our model shows that wave height of waves running through a forested section is independent of initial height or of water level. Although the underlying phenomenon of non-linear wave attenuation within coastal vegetation is well studied, implications of reducing variability in wave heights for design of ecosystem and levee combinations have not yet been properly outlined. Narrowing the range of wave heights by a vegetation field generates an adaptive levee that is robust to a whole range of external conditions rather than only to a maximum wave height. This feature can substantially reduce costs for retrofitting of levees under changing future wave climates. Thereby, in wave prone areas, inclusion of ecosystems into flood defense schemes constitutes an adaptive and safe alternative to only hard engineered flood risk measures.},

abstract = {Integration of mangroves in projects to reduce coastal flood risk is increasingly being recognised as a sustainable and cost-effective alternative. In addition to the construction of conventional hard flood protection infrastructure, mangroves not only contribute to attenuating flood events (functionality), they also recover in, and adapt to, a changing climate (persistence). The implementation of mangroves in flood risk reduction, however, remains complex. This is because the innate functionality and persistence of mangroves depend on a range of environmental conditions. Importantly, mangroves may collapse when environmental impacts or climatic changes exceed key system thresholds, bringing uncertainty into a situation where failure could endanger lives and livelihoods. The uncertainties in mangrove functionality and persistence can be dealt with by (1) improving insights in how ecological and physical processes affect mangrove functionality and persistence across scales, (2) advancing tools to accurately assess and predict mangrove functionality and persistence, and (3) adopting an adaptive management approach combined with appropriate engineering interventions to enhance mangrove functionality and persistence. Here, we review existing evidence, monitoring techniques and modelling approaches from the viewpoint of mangrove functionality and persistence. Inspired by existing guidelines for Nature-based Solutions (NbS) to reduce flood risk, we provide an operationalization for this new approach. In addition, we identify where further research efforts are required for the practical application of mangroves in coastal flood risk management. Key aspects in the variability and uncertainty of the functionality and persistence of mangroves are their failure and recovery mechanisms, which are greatly site- and storm-specific. We propose five characteristic damage regimes that result in increasing reductions of mangrove functionality as well as post-storm recovery periods. Further research on the quantification of these regimes and their thresholds is required for the successful integration of mangroves in coastal flood risk management. Ultimately, the key challenge is the development of adaptive management strategies to optimise long-term mangrove functionality and persistence, or their resilience. Such adaptive strategies should be informed by continued mangrove functionality and persistence assessments, based on continued monitoring and modelling of key mangrove thresholds, and supported through well-established guidelines.},

abstract = {Coastal river deltas are susceptible to flooding from pluvial, fluvial, and coastal flood drivers. Compound floods, which result from the co-occurrence of two or more of these drivers, typically exacerbate impacts compared to floods from a single driver. While several global flood models have been developed, these do not account for compound flooding. Local scale compound flood models provide state-of-the-art analyses but are hard to scale up as these typically are based on local datasets. Hence, there is a need for globally-applicable compound flood hazard modeling. We develop, validate and apply a 15 framework for compound flood hazard modeling, which consists of the local high-resolution 2D hydrodynamic flood model SFINCS, which is automatically set up from global datasets and loosely coupled with a global hydrodynamic river routing and flood model, as well as a global surge and tide model to account for interactions between all drivers. To test the framework, we simulate two historical compound flood events, cyclones Idai and Eloise, in the Sofala province of Mozambique, and compare the flood extent to observations from remote sensing and to the global quasi 2D CaMa-Flood 20 model. The results show that while the global and local model have similar skill in terms of the critical success index, they result in rather different flood maps. On the one hand, the local model has a higher hit ratio due to the representation of direct coastal and pluvial flooding (rain on grid) and a higher floodplain connectivity. It also shows a faster response to coastal drivers within the estuaries and more realistic flood depth maps. On the other hand, the local model has a higher false alarm ratio, which is partly explained by the inclusion of direct pluvial flooding without sufficient representation of small 25 scale (subgrid) drainage capacity. To showcase a possible application of the framework, we also determine the dominant flood drivers and transition zones between flood drivers for both events. These vary significantly between both events because of differences in the magnitude of and time lag between the flood drivers. We argue that a wide range of plausible events should be investigated to get a robust understanding of compound flood interactions, which is important to understand for flood adaptation, preparedness, and response. As the model setup and coupling is automated, reproducible, and globally 30 applicable, the presented framework is a promising step forward towards large scale compound flood hazard modeling.},

abstract = {Over the last decades, population densities in coastal areas have strongly increased. At the same time, many intertidal coastal ecosystems that provide valuable services in terms of coastal protection have greatly degraded. As a result, coastal defense has become increasingly dependent on man-made engineering solutions. Ongoing climate change processes such as sea-level rise and increased storminess, require a rethinking of current coastal defense practices including the development of innovative and cost-effective ways to protect coastlines. Integrating intertidal coastal ecosystems within coastal defense schemes offers a promising way forward. In this perspective, we specifically aim to (1) provide insight in the conditions under which ecosystems may be valuable for coastal protection, (2) discuss which might be the most promising intertidal ecosystems for this task and (3) identify knowledge gaps that currently hamper application and hence need attention from the scientific community. Ecosystems can contribute most to coastal protection by wave attenuation in areas with relatively small tidal amplitudes, and/or where intertidal areas are wide. The main knowledge gap hampering application of intertidal ecosystems within coastal defense schemes is lack in ability to account quantitatively for long-term ecosystem dynamics. Such knowledge is essential, as this will determine both the predictability and reliability of their coastal defense function. Solutions integrating intertidal ecosystems in coastal defense schemes offer promising opportunities in some situations, but require better mechanistic understanding of ecosystem dynamics in space and time to enable successful large-scale application. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We review 72 published articles to elucidate characteristics of biomass allocation and productivity of mangrove forests and also introduce recent progress on the study of mangrove allometry to solve the site- and species-specific problems. This includes the testing of a common allometric equation, which may be applicable to mangroves worldwide. The biomass of mangrove forests varies with age, dominant species, and locality. In primary mangrove forests, the above-ground biomass tends to be relatively low near the sea and increases inland. On a global scale, mangrove forests in the tropics have much higher above-ground biomass than those in temperate areas. Mangroves often accumulate large amounts of biomass in their roots, and the above-ground biomass to below-ground biomass ratio of mangrove forests is significantly low compared to that of upland forests (ANCOVA, P {\textless} 0.01). Several studies have reported on the growth increment of biomass and litter production in mangrove forests. We introduce some recent studies using the so-called "summation method" and investigate the trends in net primary production (NPP). For crown heights below 10 m, the above-ground NPP of mangrove forests is significantly higher (ANOVA, P {\textless} 0.01) than in those of tropical upland forests. The above-ground litter production is generally high in mangrove forests. Moreover, in many mangrove forests, the rate of soil respiration is low, possibly because of anaerobic soil conditions. These trends in biomass allocation, NPP, and soil respiration will result in high net ecosystem production, making mangrove forests highly efficient carbon sinks in the tropics. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1D and 2D models of flood hydraulics (HEC-RAS, LISFLOOD-FP and TELEMAC-2D) are tested on a 60 km reach of the river Severn, UK. Synoptic views of flood extent from radar remote sensing satellites have been acquired for flood events in 1998 and 2000. The three models are calibrated, using floodplain and channel friction as free parameters, against both the observed inundated area and records of downstream discharge. The predictive power of the models calibrated against inundation extent or discharge for one event can thus be measured using independent validation data for the second. The results show that for this reach both the HEC-RAS and TELEMAC-2D models can be calibrated against discharge or inundated area data and give good predictions of inundated area, whereas the LISFLOOD-FP needs to be calibrated against independent inundated area data to produce acceptable results. The different predictive performances of the models stem from their different responses to changes in friction parameterisation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper presents the new ocean subsurface optical properties obtained from two space-based lidars: the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations satellite and the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) aboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 satellite. Obtaining reliable estimates of subsurface biomass necessitates removing instrument artifacts peculiar to each sensor, that is, polarization crosstalk artifacts in the CALIOP signals and after pulsing effects arising from the ATLAS photodetectors. We validate the optical properties derived from the corrected lidar backscatter signals using MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ocean color measurements and autonomous biogeochemical Argo float profiles. Our results support the continued use of present and future spaceborne lidars to study the global plankton system and characterize its vertical structures in the upper ocean.},

abstract = {The Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), an Earth-observing laser altimetry mission, is currently providing global elevation measurements. Geolocation validation confirms the altimeter's ability to accurately position the measurement on the surface of the Earth and provides insight into the fidelity of the geolocation determination process. Surfaces well characterized by independent methods are well suited to provide a measure of the ICESat-2 geolocation accuracy through statistical comparison. This study compares airborne lidar data with the ICESat-2 along-track geolocated photon data product to determine the horizontal geolocation accuracy by minimizing the vertical residuals between datasets. At the same location arrays of corner cube retro-reflectors (CCRs) provide unique signal signatures back to the satellite from their known positions to give a deterministic solution of the laser footprint diameter and the geolocation accuracy for those cases where two or more CCRs were illuminated within one ICESat-2 transect. This passive method for diameter recovery and geolocation accuracy assessment is implemented at two locations: White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) in New Mexico and along the 88°S latitude line in Antarctica. This early on-orbit study provides results as a proof of concept for this passive validation technique. For the cases studied the diameter value ranged from 10.6 to 12 m. The variability is attributed to the statistical nature of photon-counting lidar technology and potentially, variations in the atmospheric conditions that impact signal transmission. The geolocation accuracy results from the CCR technique and airborne lidar comparisons are within the mission requirement of 6.5 m.},

abstract = {Armor damage due to wave attack is the principal failure mode to be considered when designing conventional mound breakwaters. Armor layers of mound breakwaters are typically designed using formulas in the literature for non-overtopped mound breakwaters in non-breaking wave conditions, although overtopped mound breakwaters in the depth-induced breaking wave zone are common design conditions. In this study, 2D physical tests with an armor slope H/V = 3/2 are analyzed in order to better describe the hydraulic stability of overtopped mound breakwaters with double-layer rock, double-layer randomly-place cube and single-layer Cubipod{\textregistered} armors in depth-limited breaking wave conditions. Hydraulic stability formulas are derived for each armor section (front slope, crest and rear slope) and each armor layer. The front slope of overtopped double-layer rock structures is more stable than the front slope of non-overtopped mound breakwaters in breaking wave conditions. When wave attack increases, armor damage appears first on the front slope, later on the crest and, finally, on the rear side. However, once the damage begins on the crest and rear side, the progression is much faster than on the front slope, because more wave energy is dissipated through the armored crest and rear side.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamic forces on intertidal flats vary over a range of temporal and spatial scales. These spatiotemporal inhomogeneities have implications for intertidal flat morphodynamics and ecology. We determine whether storm events are capable of altering the long-term morphological evolution of intertidal flats, and unravel the contributions of tidal flow, wind-driven flow, waves, and water depth on inhomogeneities in bed level dynamics (bed level changes over {\~{}}days) across these areas. We complement decades of bed level measurements on eight intertidal flats in two estuaries in the Netherlands with an extensive 1-month field campaign on one of those flats. Across this intertidal flat, the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of a storm event were captured, including the post-storm recovery. We show that individual events can persistently alter the morphological evolution of intertidal flats; magnitudes of some bed level changes are even comparable to years of continuous evolution. The morphological impacts of events are largely controlled by the relative timing of the forcing processes, and not solely by their magnitudes. Spatiotemporal variations in bed level dynamics of intertidal flats are driven by a combination of: (1) the inhomogeneous distributions of the hydrodynamic forcing processes (including the under-explored role of the wind); and (2) the linear proportionality between bed level dynamics and the local bed slope. {\textcopyright} 2020, The Author(s).},

Conventionally, hydrographic surveying methods are used for bathymetric surveys carried by ship-based acoustic systems, but needs high-cost resources. Space technology has provided a cost-effective alternate means for charting near shore and inaccessible waters. The optical satellite data have capabilities to offer alternate solution in near-shore region, which has been researched for past 50 years, using evolving algorithms to estimate Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB). However, there is no agreement on use of terms like approach, model, method and techniques, which have been used varyingly and interchangeably as per context of SDB research. This paper suggests a classification scheme for SDB algorithms which is also applicable to other Marine Remote Sensing studies. In this paper, based on literature available on SDB for the past five decades, an insight on SDB classification has been offered grounded in research philosophy. The SDB approaches, models, methods and techniques have been elaborated with chronological development, along with SDB studies based on them, their accuracy and errors in SDB retrieval. We have suggested a matrix of prerequisite satellite data, in-situ data resolution, methods and algorithms of SDB based on level of accuracy needs to be achieved, which will guide future researchers to select one as per their context of research.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers. The objective of this study is to investigate the computational performance and accuracy of three different implementations of a 2D flood model: sequential (Flood2D-CPP), parallel (Flood2D-PTH and Flood2D-OMP), and general purpose graphics processing unit (Flood2D-GPU). The model is based on shallow water equations (SWE) and uses an upwind-finite difference numerical formulation to simulate flood events. Two parallel versions of the model are implemented, one based on pthread and the other based on OpenMP. The GPU version has been developed using NVIDIA's CUDA library. For this study, these implementations are applied to simulate a dam break event at the Taum Sauk pump-storage hydroelectric power plant in Missouri, which occurred on December 14, 2005. The GPU implementation provided a significant speed up, up to two orders of magnitude compared with the CPU model. As predicted, the sequential model (Flood2D-CPP) reported with the lowest performance compared with the parallel and GPGPU versions, because it would take longer for a single CPU thread to perform all the calculations as opposed to multiple threads or through multiple GPU cores. Results indicate that the computational performance of both Flood2D-PTH and Flood2D-OMP improves with an increase in the number of CPU threads. The speedups of Flood2D-PTH and Flood2D-OMP are maximized at eight threads, but much less than the theoretical maximum. In general, even though Flood2D-GPU had significance performance, the comparison indicated the potential for optimizing Flood2D-PTH and Flood2D-OMP models to simulate larger computational domains.},

Based on these models, matched filters are used to detect the characteristic nonstationarities in the altimeter data caused by seamounts and ocean currents such as the gulf stream. The geostrophic velocities of detected ocean currents are then estimated using Kalman smoothers.

abstract = {A recent suite of new global-scale satellite sensors and regional-scale airborne campaigns are providing a wealth of remote sensing data capable of dramatically advancing our current understanding of the spatial distribution of forest structure and carbon stocks. However, a baseline for forest stature and biomass estimates has yet to be established for the wide array of available remote sensing products. At present, it remains unclear how the estimates from these sensors compare to one another in terrestrial forests, with a clear dearth of studies in high carbon density mangrove ecosystems. In the tallest mangrove forest on Earth (Pongara National Park, Gabon), we leverage the data collected during the AfriSAR campaign to evaluate 17 state-of-the-art sensor data products across the full range of height and biomass known to exist globally in mangrove forest ecosystems, providing a much-needed baseline for sensor performance. Our major findings are: (Houghton, Hall, Goetz) height estimates are not consistent across products, with opposing trends in relative and absolute errors, highlighting the need for an adaptive approach to constraining height estimates (Panet al., 2011); radar height estimates had the lowest calibration error and bias, with further improvements using LiDAR fusion (Bonan, 2008); biomass variability and uncertainty strongly depends on forest stature, with variation across products increasing with canopy height, while relative biomass variation was highest in low-stature stands (Le Qu{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}et al., 2017); a remote sensing product's sensitivity to variations in canopy structure is more important than the absolute accuracy of height estimates (Mitchardet al., 2014); locally-calibrated area-wide totals are more representative than generalized global biomass models for high-precision biomass estimates. The findings presented here provide critical baseline expectations for height and biomass predictions across the full range of mangrove forest stature, which can be directly applied to current (TanDEM-X, GEDI, ICESat-2) and future (NISAR, BIOMASS) global-scale forest monitoring missions.},

abstract = {Bangladesh was introduced with the polder system during 1960s to secure agricultural production from salinity intrusion. Existing polder design practice follows traditional return-period based approach. The article introduces a risk-based framework to determine optimal polder level in the coastal area of Bangladesh. Distinguishable features of risk-based framework over previous method is its inclusion of risk cost and optimal project size. Storm surge flooding was considered as the hazard intensity in this study. Agricultural losses due to storm surge flooding were factorized to get total losses. The optimum level of the polder was determined by summing up the annualized costs of raising polder and the risk cost due to storm surge flooding. The optimal polder level was found to be about 5.63 mPWD with a return period of about 37 years. The optimum design return-period for the polder in Bangladesh is considerably low compared to the current global design practices. This underscores the local peculiarities of the area (e.g., land use, economic activities, hazard sensitivity) in balancing incremental investment costs with reduced risk costs in a risk-based concept. The demonstration of the risk-based concept that is made for designing a coastal polder has potential for replication in other infrastructure designs.},

abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems are threatened by climate change. We review the state of knowledge of mangrove vulnerability and responses to predicted climate change and consider adaptation options. Based on available evidence, of all the climate change outcomes, relative sea-level rise may be the greatest threat to mangroves. Most mangrove sediment surface elevations are not keeping pace with sea-level rise, although longer term studies from a larger number of regions are needed. Rising sea-level will have the greatest impact on mangroves experiencing net lowering in sediment elevation, where there is limited area for landward migration. The Pacific Islands mangroves have been demonstrated to be at high risk of substantial reductions. There is less certainty over other climate change outcomes and mangrove responses. More research is needed on assessment methods and standard indicators of change in response to effects from climate change, while regional monitoring networks are needed to observe these responses to enable educated adaptation. Adaptation measures can offset anticipated mangrove losses and improve resistance and resilience to climate change. Coastal planning can adapt to facilitate mangrove migration with sea-level rise. Management of activities within the catchment that affect long-term trends in the mangrove sediment elevation, better management of other stressors on mangroves, rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas, and increases in systems of strategically designed protected area networks that include mangroves and functionally linked ecosystems through representation, replication and refugia, are additional adaptation options. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {It can be expensive and difficult to collect direct bathymetry data for nearshore regions, especially in highenergy locations where there are temporally and spatially varying bathymetric features like sandbars. As a result, there has been increasing interest in remote assessment techniques for estimating bathymetry. Recent efforts have combinedKalman filter-based techniques with indirect video-based observations for bathymetry inversion. Here, we estimate nearshore bathymetry by utilizing observedwave celerity andwave height, which are related to bathymetry through phase-averaged wave dynamics. We present a modified compressed-state Kalman filter (CSKF) method, a fast and scalable Kalman filter method for linear and nonlinear problems with large numbers of unknowns andmeasurements, and apply it to two nearshore bathymetry estimation problems. To illustrate the robustness and accuracy of our method, we compare its performancewith that of two ensemble-based approaches on twin bathymetry estimation problems with profiles based on surveys taken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck, North Carolina. We first consider an estimation problem for a temporally constant bathymetry profile. Then we estimate bathymetry as it evolves in time. Our results indicate that the CSKF method is more accurate and robust than the ensemble-based methods with the same computational cost. The superior performance is due to the optimal low-rank representation of the covariancematrices.},

They form an important link between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and are one of the most productive ecosystems with a primary productivity of 2.5 g carbon/m2 per day [1]. Mangrove litter provides large amounts of carbon (C) to coastal and offshore marine ecosystems and contributes over 10{\%} of the dissolved organic C (DOC) to ocean sediments worldwide [2]. Mangroves also protect coastal areas from wave action, erosion, storms, and tidal waves. Despite their known benefi ts as coastal buffers and biodiversity harbors, mangrove areas are being altered and destroyed by anthropogenic impacts and their cover has decreased by 35{\%} in the past 20 years [3]. Mangrove forests are ecologically and economically important.

abstract = {A current hindrance to the scientific use of available bathymetric lidar point clouds is the frequent lack of accurate and thorough segmentation of seafloor points. Furthermore, scientific end-users typically lack access to waveforms, trajectories, and other upstream data, and also do not have the time or expertise to perform extensive manual point cloud editing. To address these needs, this study seeks to develop and test a novel clustering approach to seafloor segmentation that solely uses georeferenced point clouds. The proposed approach does not make any assumptions regarding the statistical distribution of points in the input point cloud. Instead, the approach organizes the point cloud into an inverse histogram and finds a gap that best separates the seafloor using the proposed peak-detection method. The proposed approach is evaluated with datasets acquired in Florida with a Riegl VQ-880-G bathymetric LiDAR system. The parameters are optimized through a sensitivity analysis with a point-wise comparison between the extracted seafloor and ground truth. With optimized parameters, the proposed approach achieved F1-scores of 98.14–98.77{\%}, which outperforms three popular existing methods. Further, we compared seafloor points with Reson 8125 MBES hydrographic survey data. The results indicate that seafloor points were detected successfully with vertical errors of −0.190 ± 0.132 m and −0.185 ± 0.119 m ($\mu$ ± $\sigma$) for two test datasets.},

The energy dissipation in the frequency domain is determined by treating the mangrove forest as a random media with certain characteristics using the geometry of mangrove trunks and their locations. Initial nonlinear governing equations are linearized using the concept of minimalization in the stochastic sense and interactions between mangrove trunks and roots have been introduced through the modification of the drag coefficients. To see the effectiveness of the mangrove forest in attenuating wave energy the analytical model was applied to two types of mangrove forest i.e. Rhizophora and Ceriops forests. The resulting rate of wave energy attenuation depends strongly on the density of the mangrove forest, and on diameter of mangrove roots and trunks. More effective wave energy attenuation is shown by Rhizophora.},

abstract = {The accuracy of state-of-the-art global barotropic tide models is assessed using bottom pressure data, coastal tide gauges, satellite altimetry, various geodetic data on Antarctic ice shelves, and independent tracked satellite orbit perturbations. Tide models under review include empirical, purely hydrodynamic ("forward"), and assimilative dynamical, i.e., constrained by observations. Ten dominant tidal constituents in the diurnal, semidiurnal, and quarter-diurnal bands are considered. Since the last major model comparison project in 1997, models have improved markedly, especially in shallow-water regions and also in the deep ocean. The root-sum-square differences between tide observations and the best models for eight major constituents are approximately 0.9, 5.0, and 6.5 cm for pelagic, shelf, and coastal conditions, respectively. Large intermodel discrepancies occur in high latitudes, but testing in those regions is impeded by the paucity of high-quality in situ tide records. Long-wavelength components of models tested by analyzing satellite laser ranging measurements suggest that several models are comparably accurate for use in precise orbit determination, but analyses of GRACE intersatellite ranging data show that all models are still imperfect on basin and subbasin scales, especially near Antarctica. For the M2 constituent, errors in purely hydrodynamic models are now almost comparable to the 1980-era Schwiderski empirical solution, indicating marked advancement in dynamical modeling. Assessing model accuracy using tidal currents remains problematic owing to uncertainties in in situ current meter estimates and the inability to isolate the barotropic mode. Velocity tests against both acoustic tomography and current meters do confirm that assimilative models perform better than purely hydrodynamic models.},

abstract = {Ocean-color remote sensing is routinely used to derive marine geophysical parameters from sensor-observed spectral water-leaving radiances. However, in clear geometrically shallow regions, traditional ocean-color algorithms can be confounded by light reflected from the seafloor. Such regions are typically referred to as {\&}{\#}x201C;optically shallow{\&}{\#}x201D;. When performing spatiotemporal analyses of ocean color datasets, optically shallow features such as submerged sand banks and coral reefs can lead to unexpected regional biases. Most contemporary approaches mask or flag suspected optically shallow pixels based on ancillary bathymetric data. However, the extent to which seafloor reflectance contaminates the water-leaving radiance is dependent on bathymetry, water clarity and seafloor albedo. In this paper, an approach for flagging optically shallow pixels has been developed that considers all three of these variables. In the method, the optical depth of the water column at 547 nm, {\&}{\#}x03B6;(547), is predicted from bathymetric data and estimated water-column optical properties. If {\&}{\#}x03B6;(547) is less then the pre-defined threshold, a pixel is flagged as potentially optically shallow. Radiative transfer modeling was used to identify a conservative threshold value of {\&}{\#}x03B6;(547) = 20 for a bright sand seafloor. In addition, pixels in waters shallower than 5 m are also flagged. We also examined how varying bathymetric datasets may affect the optically shallow flag using MODIS data. It is anticipated that the optically shallow flag will benefit end-users when quality controlling derived ocean color products. Further, the flag may prove useful as a mechanism for switching between optically deep and shallow algorithms during ocean color processing.},

abstract = {Digital data from Landsat's Multiple Spectral Scanners (MSS) are used to calculate the amount of radiation received from sea level at the position of the satellite. We investigated the atmospheric degradation of the signal because very little is known about it, and because it is needed for eliminating atmospheric effects on the radiance data. The magnitude of degradation is estimated for clear sky and stable conditions, and is subtracted from the total radiance to give that fraction of the radiance which contains information of oceanographic interest. This amount of radiance is then related to sediment concentration. An error analysis for calculating the remotely sensed radiance and relating it to the ground truth is also presented in the paper. As a result, maps of the surface radiance and sediment distributions near the mouth of the Fraser River are produced from Computer Compatible Tapes (CCTs). These maps are not only useful in monitoring the flow characteristics, they also show detailed features which are very difficult to detect visually in the satellite images. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Accurate bathymetric data is essential for marine, coastal ecosystems, and related studies. In the past decades, a lot of studies were investigated to obtain bathymetric data in shallow waters using satellite remotely sensed data. Satellite multispectral imagery has been widely used to estimate shallow water depths based on empirical models and physics-based models. However, the in-situ water depth information is essential (as the priori) to use the empirical model in a specific area, which limits its application, especially for remote reefs. In this study, the bathymetric maps in shallow waters were produced based on empirical models with only satellite remotely sensed data (i.e., the new ICESat-2 bathymetric points and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery). The bathymetric points from the spaceborne ICESat-2 lidar were used in place of the in-situ auxiliary bathymetric points to train the classical empirical models (i.e., the linear model and the band ratio model). The bathymetric points were firstly extracted from noisy ICESat-2 raw data photons by an improved point cloud processing algorithm, and then were corrected for bathymetric errors (which were caused by the refraction effect in the water column, the refraction effect on the water surface, and the fluctuation effect on the water surface). With the trained empirical models and Sentinel-2 multispectral images, the bathymetric maps were produced for Yongle Atoll, in the South China Sea and the lagoon near Acklins Island and Long Cay, to the southeast of Bahama with four-date Sentinel-2 images. The bathymetry performance (including the accuracy and consistency of multi-date data) was evaluated and compared with the in-situ measurements. The results indicate that the bathymetric accuracy is well, and the RMSE is lower or close to 10{\%} of the maximum depth for the two models with four-date images in two study areas. The consistency of multi-date data is well with the mean R2 of 0.97. The main novelties of this study are that the accuracy bathymetric points can be obtained from the ICESat-2 raw data using the proposed signal processing and error correction method, and using the ICESat-2 bathymetric points, the satellite multispectral imagery based on empirical models is no longer limited by local priori measurements, which were essential in previous studies. Hence, In the future, with the help of free and open-access satellite data (i.e., ICESat-2 data and Sentinel-2 imagery), this approach can be extended to a larger scale to obtain bathymetric maps in the shallow water of coastal areas, surroundings of islands and reefs, and inland waters.},

abstract = {The nearshore region exhibits many striking morphological patterns with a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The formation of these rhythmic features has been initially ascribed, depending on the pattern in question, to spatial structures in the flow or geological constrains. These forcing templates have been hypothesized to provide the spatial structure that becomes imprinted on the shoreline or seabed morphology. More recently, new explanations for rhythmic patterns have involved interactions between fluid flow and sediment transport that create morphological feedbacks and lead to pattern self-organization. While forcing-template models do not explicitly treat transport of the sediment that makes up the pattern, self-organization models focus on the strong couplings within flow/sediment systems, and on interactions between emergent structures. We illustrate the sweeping shift from template explanations to self-organization by discussing four nearshore patterns: beach cusps, surfzone crescentic sandbars, inner-shelf sorted bedforms, and large-scale cuspate shorelines. Models involving self-organization show that local interactions between flow and sediment transport can collectively give rise to patterns with large-scale coherence and that the driving feedbacks can be associated with either topographical or grain-size composition instabilities. An approach based on self-organization also allows researchers to establish limitations in the predictability of the occurrence of rhythmic patterns and characteristics as well as to study mechanisms leading to the observed variability of pattern or lack of regularity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Empirical methods for estimating shallow-water bathymetry using passive multispectral satellite imagery are robust and globally applicable, in theory, but they require copious local measurements of water depth for algorithm calibration. Such calibration data have historically been unavailable for most locations, but NASA's Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), a satellite-based LiDAR, might hold unique promise to fill this critical data gap. Although ICESat-2 was not designed as a marine altimeter, its ATLAS sensor consists of six green (532 nm) lasers that can penetrate a water surface and return photons reflected by the seabed, thereby generating bathymetric profiles. Utilizing TCarta's NSF SBIR-funded Space-Based Laser Bathymetry Extraction Tool and ICESat-2's ATL03 geolocated photon data product, we have compared ICESat-2 bathymetric retrievals with a portfolio of soundings acquired in situ using a vessel-mounted single-beam echosounder. This analysis demonstrated very high correlation (R2 = 0.96) between the field and space-based bathymetry data. The comparisons were made at multiple Caribbean and Pacific coral reef sites over water depths ranging from 1 to 20 m. Results suggest that ICESat-2 could be an effective approach for calibrating and validating empirical and radiative transfer methods, alike, for estimating shallow-water bathymetry from remote sensing imagery, thereby enabling the immediate potential for shallow-water bathymetric mapping of Earth's reefs.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to compare two new generation low-complexity tools, AutoRoute and Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND), with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System, HEC-RAS 2D). The assessment was conducted on two hydrologically different and geographically distant test-cases in the United States, including the 16,900 km 2 Cedar River (CR) watershed in Iowa and a 62 km 2 domain along the Black Warrior River (BWR) in Alabama. For BWR, twelve different configurations were set up for each of the models, including four different terrain setups (e.g. with and without channel bathymetry and a levee), and three flooding conditions representing moderate to extreme hazards at 10-, 100-, and 500-year return periods. For the CR watershed, models were compared with a simplistic terrain setup (without bathymetry and any form of hydraulic controls) and one flooding condition (100-year return period). Input streamflow forcing data representing these hypothetical events were constructed by applying a new fusion approach on National Water Model outputs. Simulated inundation extent and depth from AutoRoute, HAND, and HEC-RAS 2D were compared with one another and with the corresponding FEMA reference estimates. Irrespective of the configurations, the low-complexity models were able to produce inundation extents similar to HEC-RAS 2D, with AutoRoute showing slightly higher accuracy than the HAND model. Among four terrain setups, the one including both levee and channel bathymetry showed lowest fitness score on the spatial agreement of inundation extent, due to the weak physical representation of low-complexity models compared to a hydrodynamic model. For inundation depth, the low-complexity models showed an overestimating tendency, especially in the deeper segments of the channel. Based on such reasonably good prediction skills, low-complexity flood models can be considered as a suitable alternative for fast predictions in large-scale hyper-resolution operational frameworks, without completely overriding hydrodynamic models' efficacy.},

abstract = {Mangroves are a special form of vegetation as they exist at the boundary of terrestrial and marine environment. They have a special role in supporting fisheries and in the stabilizing the tropical coastal zones. Biochemical and trophodynamic processes in the mangroves are strongly linked to water movement, due to tides and waves. In this paper we present the theoretical attempt to predict the attenuation of wind-induced random surface waves in the mangrove forest. The energy dissipation in the frequency domain is determined by treating the mangrove forest as a random media with certain characteristics determined using the geometry of mangrove trunks and their locations. Initial nonlinear governing equations are linearized using the concept of minimalization in the stochastic sense and interactions between mangrove trunks and roots have been introduced through the modification of the drag coefficients. The resulting rate of wave energy attenuation depends strongly on the density of the mangrove forest, diameter of mangrove roots and trunks, and on the spectral characteristics of the incident waves. Examples of numerical calculations as well as preliminary results from observation of wave attenuation through mangrove forests at Townsville (Australia) and Iriomote Island (Japan) are given.},

abstract = {A new global coastal database has been developed within the context of the DINAS-COAST project. The database covers the world's coasts, excluding Antarctica, and includes information on more than 80 physical, ecological, and socioeconomic parameters of the coastal zone. The database provides the base data for the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment modelling tool that the DINAS-COAST project has produced. In order to comply with the requirements of the modelling tool, it is based on a data model in which all information is referenced to more than 12,000 linear coastal segments of variable length. For efficiency of data storage, six other geographic features (administrative units, countries, rivers, tidal basins or estuaries, world heritage sites, and climate grid cells) are used to reference some data, but all are linked to the linear segment structure. This fundamental linear data structure is unique for a global database and represents an efficient solution to the problem of representing and storing coastal data. The database has been specifically designed to support impact and vulnerability analysis to sea-level rise at a range of scales up to global. Due to the structure, consistency, user-friendliness, and wealth of information in the database, it has potential wider application to analysis and modelling of the world's coasts, especially at regional to global scales.},

abstract = {Worldwide, communities are facing increasing flood risk, due to more frequent and intense hazards and rising exposure through more people living along coastlines and in flood plains. Nature-based Solutions (NbS), such as mangroves, and riparian forests, offer huge potential for adaptation and risk reduction. The capacity of trees and forests to attenuate waves and mitigate storm damages receives massive attention, especially after extreme storm events. However, application of forests in flood mitigation strategies remains limited to date, due to lack of real-scale measurements on the performance under extreme conditions. Experiments executed in a large-scale flume with a willow forest to dissipate waves show that trees are hardly damaged and strongly reduce wave and run-up heights, even when maximum wave heights are up to 2.5 m. It was observed for the first time that the surface area of the tree canopy is most relevant for wave attenuation and that the very flexible leaves limitedly add to effectiveness. Overall, the study shows that forests can play a significant role in reducing wave heights and run-up under extreme conditions. Currently, this potential is hardly used but may offer future benefits in achieving more adaptive levee designs.},

abstract = {Increasing human populations around the global coastline have caused extensive loss, degradation and fragmentation of coastal ecosystems, threatening the delivery of important ecosystem services1. As a result, alarming losses of mangrove, coral reef, seagrass, kelp forest and coastal marsh ecosystems have occurred1–6. However, owing to the difficulty of mapping intertidal areas globally, the distribution and status of tidal flats—one of the most extensive coastal ecosystems—remain unknown7. Here we present an analysis of over 700,000 satellite images that maps the global extent of and change in tidal flats over the course of 33 years (1984–2016). We find that tidal flats, defined as sand, rock or mud flats that undergo regular tidal inundation7, occupy at least 127,921 km2 (124,286–131,821 km2, 95{\%} confidence interval). About 70{\%} of the global extent of tidal flats is found in three continents (Asia (44{\%} of total), North America (15.5{\%} of total) and South America (11{\%} of total)), with 49.2{\%} being concentrated in just eight countries (Indonesia, China, Australia, the United States, Canada, India, Brazil and Myanmar). For regions with sufficient data to develop a consistent multi-decadal time series—which included East Asia, the Middle East and North America—we estimate that 16.02{\%} (15.62–16.47{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval) of tidal flats were lost between 1984 and 2016. Extensive degradation from coastal development1, reduced sediment delivery from major rivers8,9, sinking of riverine deltas8,10, increased coastal erosion and sea-level rise11 signal a continuing negative trajectory for tidal flat ecosystems around the world. Our high-spatial-resolution dataset delivers global maps of tidal flats, which substantially advances our understanding of the distribution, trajectory and status of these poorly known coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {Large parts of the Netherlands are below sea level. Therefore, it is important to have insight into the possible consequences and risks of flooding. In this article, an analysis of the risks due to flooding of the dike ring area South Holland in the Netherlands is presented. For different flood scenarios the potential number of fatalities is estimated. Results indicate that a flood event in this area can expose large and densely populated areas and result in hundreds to thousands of fatalities. Evacuation of South Holland before a coastal flood will be difficult due to the large amount of time required for evacuation and the limited time available. By combination with available information regarding the probability of occurrence of different flood scenarios, the flood risks have been quantified. The probability of death for a person in South Holland due to flooding, the so-called individual risk, is small. The probability of a flood disaster with many fatalities, the so-called societal risk, is relatively large in comparison with the societal risks in other sectors in the Netherlands, such as the chemical sector and aviation. The societal risk of flooding appears to be unacceptable according to some of the existing risk limits that have been proposed in literature. These results indicate the necessity of a further societal discussion on the acceptable level of flood risk in the Netherlands and the need for additional risk reducing measures. {\textcopyright} 2008 Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract = {With a large part of the world's population residing in coastal areas, and largely depending on the coastal environment, monitoring natural and human-induced coastal changes are paramount to understand the dynamic and vulnerability of these coastal systems/communities. To understand changes in coastal areas, e.g. environmental and social resilience to environmental change, local measurements are inadequate. Such large-scale issues can only be addressed with perhaps less accurate but large scale measurements from space. Considering vulnerability or exposure to coastal flooding, both the bathymetry (underwater) and topography (above water) are vital boundary conditions to understand and accurately estimate impacts on short (storms) and long (inter-seasonal) time-scales. In this work, we estimate the coastal bathymetry and topography with the optical VEN$\mu$S satellite for every single overpass at the Field Research Facility of the US Army Corps of Engineers at Duck, NC. The experimental VEN$\mu$S satellite enables estimation of the topography and bathymetry by two repetitive identical images with a small time-lag. This capability proofs to result in topographies with a few meters accuracy and the bathymetry estimation is at best a few decimetres accurate. As a base for future Earth Observation missions such as Landsat or Sentinel 2, VEN$\mu$S shows that higher resolution imagery (5 m), repetitive bands and a revisit time of only 2 days, enables unprecedented land/sea monitoring.},

abstract = {The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), equipped with the advanced topographic laser altimeter system (ATLAS), is a new measurement strategy that includes a photon-counting technique. Employing such an advanced system facilitates highly accurate measurement of changes in the land surface of the Earth, as well as water depths, thereby providing a novel opportunity for nearshore bathymetry. The main problem in photon-counting bathymetry is the precise identification and separation of photons with different density distributions on the water surface and water-column. Further, automatic detection of the signal photon of the water surface and bottom from the noise photon presents a problem. To overcome such problems, we propose a novel, validated, adaptive variable ellipse filtering bathymetric method (AVEBM). This method can precisely identify and separate the photons in the above-water, water surface, and water-column regions. Filter parameters can be determined automatically by the density distribution of photons in different water environments and water depths, and the signal photons of the water surface and bottom can be detected precisely to conduct bathymetry. To ensure and improve the accuracy and reliability of the AVEBM, datasets of different photon densities were selected and employed in conducting experiments. Further, we used in situ data and remote sensing images to validate and estimate the detection accuracy of the signal photon and bathymetric accuracy. The experimental results indicated that bathymetric accuracy based on the AVEBM method reached 0.48 m of root mean square error (RMSE) when we employed three ATL03 datasets in combination for Qilianyu Islands. Moreover, the bathymetric accuracy reached 0.79 m of RMSE when comparing with the SDB result in Shanhu Island. Results showed that the proposed AVEBM method facilitated highly accurate signal photon detection and bathymetry.},

abstract = {Allthough nonparametric kernel density estimation is nowadays a standard technique in explorative data{\{}analysis, there is still a big dispute on how to assess the quality of the estimate and which choice of bandwidth is optimal. The main argument is on whether one should use the Integrated Squared Error or the Mean Integrated Squared Error to deene the optimal bandwidth. In the last years a lot of research was done to develop bandwidth selection methods which try to estimate the optimal bandwidth obtained by either of this error criterion. This paper summarizes the most important arguments for each criterion and gives an overview over the existing bandwidth selection methods. We also summarize the small sample behaviour of these methods as assessed in several Monte{\{}Carlo studies. These Monte{\{}Carlo studies are all restricted to very small sample sizes due to the fact that the numerical eeort of estimating the optimal bandwidth by any of these bandwidth selection methods is proportional to the square of the sample size. This high computational cost for estimating the optimal bandwidth can be signiicantly reduced by binning or discretization methods. These methods will be explained and it will be shown how the presented bandwidth selectors can be implemented in a much faster way.}}}},

abstract = {Nearshore slope, defined as the cross-shore gradient of the subaqueous profile, is an important input parameter which affects hydrodynamic and morphological coastal processes. It is used in both local and large-scale coastal investigations. However, due to unavailability of data, most studies, especially those that focus on continental or global scales, have historically adopted a uniform nearshore slope. This simplifying assumption could however have far-reaching implications for predictions/projections thus obtained. Here, we present the first global dataset of nearshore slopes with a resolution of 1km at almost 620000 points along the global coastline. To this end, coastal profiles were constructed using global topo-bathymetric datasets. The results show that the nearshore slopes vary substantially around the world. An assessment of coastline recession driven by sea level rise (SLR) (for an arbitrary 0.5m SLR) with a globally uniform coastal slope of 1:100, as carried out in previous studies, and with the spatially variable coastal slopes computed herein shows that, on average, the former approach would underestimate coastline recession by about 40{\%}, albeit with significant spatial variation.

abstract = {The upcoming Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission will offer prospects for mapping and monitoring biomass and carbon of terrestrial ecosystems over large areas using photon counting LiDAR data. In this paper, we aim to develop a methodology to derive terrain elevation and vegetation canopy height from test-bed sensor data and further pre-validate the capacity of the mission to meet its science objectives for the ecosystem community. We investigated a novel methodological framework with two essential steps for characterizing terrain and canopy height using Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental LiDAR (MABEL) data and simulated ICESat-2 data with various vegetation conditions. Our algorithm first implements a multi-level noise filtering approach to minimize noise photons and subsequently classifies the remaining photons into ground and top of canopy using an overlapping moving window method and cubic spline interpolation. Results of noise filtering show that the design of the multi-level filtering process is effective to identify background noise and preserve signal photons in the raw data. Moreover, calibration results using MABEL and simulated ICESat-2 data share similar trends with the retrieved terrain being more accurate than the retrieved canopy height, and the nighttime results being better than corresponding daytime results. Compared to the results of simulated ICESat-2 data, MABEL data achieve lower accuracy for ground and canopy heights in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), which may partly result from the inconsistency between MABEL and reference data. Specifically, simulated ICESat-2 data using 115 various nighttime and daytime scenarios, yield average RMSE values of 1.83 m and 2.80 m for estimated ground elevation, and 2.70 m and 3.59 m for estimated canopy height. Additionally, the accuracy assessment of percentile heights of simulated ICESat-2 data further substantiates the robustness of the methodology from different perspectives. The methodology developed in this study illustrates plausible ways of processing the data that are structurally similar to expected ICESat-2 data and holds the potential to be a benchmark for further method adjustment once genuine ICESat-2 are available.},

Because these existing NCMP bathymetric lidar datasets were not collected to NOAA hydrographic surveying standards, it is unclear if, and under what circumstances, they might aid in meeting certain hydrographic surveying requirements. The NCMP bathymetric lidar data were evaluated through a comparison against NOAA's hydrographic Services Division (HSD) data derived from acoustic surveys. Key goals included assessing whether NCMP bathymetry can be used to fill in the data gap shoreward of the navigable area limit line (0 to 4 m depth) and if there is potential for applying NCMP TBL data to nearshore areas deeper than 10 m. The study results were used to make recommendations for future use of the data in NOAA. Additionally, this work may allow the development of future operating procedures and workflows using other topographic-­-bathymetric lidar datasets to help update nearshore areas of the NOAA charts.},

abstract = {Knowledge of reservoir bathymetry is essential for many studies on terrestrial hydrological and biogeochemical processes. However, there are currently no cost-effective approaches to derive reservoir bathymetry at the global scale. This study explores the potential of generating high-resolution global bathymetry using elevation data collected by the 532-nm Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) onboard the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2). The novel algorithm was developed and tested using the ICESat-2 airborne prototype, the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL), with Landsat-based water classifications (from 1982 to 2017). MABEL photon elevations were paired with Landsat water occurrence percentiles to establish the elevation-area (E-A) relationship, which in turn was applied to the percentile image to obtain partial bathymetry over the historic dynamic range of reservoir area. The bathymetry for the central area was projected to achieve the full bathymetry. The bathymetry image was then embedded onto the digital elevation model (DEM). Results were validated over Lake Mead against survey data. Results over four transects show coefficient of determination (R2) values from 0.82 to 0.99 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values from 1.18 to 2.36 m. In addition, the E-A and elevation-storage (E-S) curves have RMSEs of 1.56 m and 0.08 km3, respectively. Over the entire dynamic reservoir area, the derived bathymetry agrees very well with independent survey data, except for within the highest and lowest percentile bands. With abundant overpassing tracks and high spatial resolution, the newly launched ICESat-2 should enable the derivation of bathymetry over an unprecedented number of reservoirs.},

abstract = {Global models of tide, storm surge, and wave setup are used to obtain projections of episodic coastal flooding over the coming century. The models are extensively validated against tide gauge data and the impact of uncertainties and assumptions on projections estimated in detail. Global “hotspots” where there is projected to be a significant change in episodic flooding by the end of the century are identified and found to be mostly concentrated in north western Europe and Asia. Results show that for the case of, no coastal protection or adaptation, and a mean RCP8.5 scenario, there will be an increase of 48{\%} of the world's land area, 52{\%} of the global population and 46{\%} of global assets at risk of flooding by 2100. A total of 68{\%} of the global coastal area flooded will be caused by tide and storm events with 32{\%} due to projected regional sea level rise.},

@article{Vuik2018,
abstract = {Vegetated foreshores adjacent to engineered structures (so-called hybrid flood defenses), are considered to have high potential in reducing flood risk, even in the face of sea level rise and increasing storminess. However, foreshores such as salt marshes and mangrove forests are generally characterized by relatively strong temporal and spatial variations in geometry and vegetation characteristics (e.g., stem height and density), which causes uncertainties with regards to their protective value under extreme storm conditions. Currently, no method is available to assess the failure probability of a hybrid flood defense, taking into account the aforementioned uncertainties. This paper presents a method to determine the failure probability of a hybrid flood defense, integrating models and stochastic parameters that describe dike failure and wave propagation over a vegetated foreshore. Two dike failure mechanisms are considered: failure due to (i) wave overtopping and (ii) wave impact on revetments. Results show that vegetated foreshores cause a reduction in failure probability for both mechanisms. This effect is more pronounced for wave impact on revetments than for wave overtopping, since revetment failure occurs at relatively low water levels. The relevance of different uncertainties depends on the protection level and associated dike height and strength. For relatively low dikes (i.e., low protection levels), vegetation remains stable in design conditions, and plays an important role in reducing wave loads. In case of higher protection levels, hence for more robust dikes, vegetation is less important than foreshore geometry, because of expected stem breakage of the vegetation under these more extreme conditions. The integrated analysis of uncertainties in hydraulic loads, dike geometry and foreshore characteristics in this paper enables the comparison between nature-based flood defenses and traditionally engineered solutions, and allows coastal engineers to design hybrid flood defenses worldwide.},

abstract = {Although understanding the requisite hydrodynamic habitat for mangrove vegetation is vital for successful restoration efforts, few studies have quantitatively assessed the in-situ tolerance of mangroves to relevant physical forcing mechanisms. In this work, hydrodynamic thresholds for the persistence of mangrove vegetation (Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia germinans, and Laguncularia racemosa) are assessed using a hindcast wind-wave model coupled with a high-resolution shoreline survey, with analysis including 383 km of shoreline located in a microtidal estuary along the Atlantic coast of Florida (north Indian River Lagoon, USA). Observed mangrove distribution patterns were most strongly correlated with the modelled wave climate (p {\textless} 0.001) and measured intertidal slope (So; p {\textless} 0.001), and mangrove presence probabilities were maximized for sample sites characterized by low slopes (So {\textless} 0.5) and weakly energetic waves (80th percentile wave height: H80 {\textless} 2.5 cm). Critical wave thresholds (mean ± 95{\%} confidence interval) of H50=4.2 ± 0.4cm and H80 = 8.0 ± 0.5cm were estimated for 50th and 80th percentile wave heights, respectively, representing the wave climate limits above which mangrove presence probabilities fall below 50{\%}. Low intertidal slopes were observed to enhance mangrove wave tolerance (So≅0; H80 = 9 cm) while high slopes led to dramatic reductions in threshold wave heights (So≅1; H80 = 4 cm). These results have important implications for future restoration efforts, providing the first available quantitative wave thresholds for mangrove habitat suitability.},

abstract = {No accurate global lowland digital terrain model (DTM) exists to date that allows reliable quantification of coastal lowland flood risk, currently and with sea-level rise. We created the first global coastal lowland DTM that is derived from satellite LiDAR data. The global LiDAR lowland DTM (GLL{\_}DTM{\_}v1) at 0.05-degree resolution ({\~{}}5 {\&}times; 5 km) is created from ICESat-2 data collected between 14 October 2018 and 13 May 2020. It is accurate within 0.5 m for 83.4{\%} of land area below 10 m above mean sea level (+MSL), with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) value of 0.54 m, compared to three local area DTMs for three major lowland areas: the Everglades, the Netherlands, and the Mekong Delta. This accuracy is far higher than that of four existing global digital elevation models (GDEMs), which are derived from satellite radar data, namely, SRTM90, MERIT, CoastalDEM, and TanDEM-X, that we find to be accurate within 0.5 m for 21.1{\%}, 12.9{\%}, 18.3{\%}, and 37.9{\%} of land below 10 m +MSL, respectively, with corresponding RMSE values of 2.49 m, 1.88 m, 1.54 m, and 1.59 m. Globally, we find 3.23, 2.12, and 1.05 million km2 of land below 10, 5, and 2 m +MSL. The 0.93 million km2 of land below 2 m +MSL identified between 60N and 56S is three times the area indicated by SRTM90 that is currently the GDEM most used in flood risk assessments, confirming that studies to date are likely to have underestimated areas at risk of flooding. Moreover, the new dataset reveals extensive forested land areas below 2 m +MSL in Papua and the Amazon Delta that are largely undetected by existing GDEMs. We conclude that the recent availability of satellite LiDAR data presents a major and much-needed step forward for studies and policies requiring accurate elevation models. GLL{\_}DTM{\_}v1 is available in the public domain, and the resolution will be increased in later versions as more satellite LiDAR data become available.},

The depths of the aquatic bodies, indispensable for the representation of those, are obtained through the bathymetric surveys. However, the result of a bathymetric sampling is a grid of points that, for itself, it is not capable of generating directly the Digital Model of Depth (DMD), being necessary the use of interpolators. Currently, there are more than 40 available scientific methods of interpolation, each one with its particularities and characteristics. This study has the objective to analise, comparing, the efficiency of Universal Kriging (UK) and of the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) in the computational representation of bathymetric surfaces, varying in a decreasing way the quantity of sample points. Through the results, we can be stated the superiority of the interpolator Universal Kriging in efficiency in creating DMD with basis in the bathymetric surveys data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This is an important capability for coastal science, maritime intelligence and shallow water benthic monitoring at the global scale. ICESat-2 elevations are also becoming a critical component of satellite-derived bathymetry where multispectral imagery uses the measurements to create broad spatial maps with absolute vertical bathymetric depths.

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

abstract = {Mangrove forests grow in the inter-tidal areas along coastlines, rivers, and tidal lands. They are highly productive ecosystems and provide numerous ecological and economic goods and services for humans. In order to develop programs for applying guided conservation and enhancing ecosystem management, accurate and regularly updated maps on their distribution, extent, and species composition are needed. Recent advances in remote sensing techniques have made it possible to gather the required information about mangrove ecosystems. Since costs are a limiting factor in generating land cover maps, the latest remote sensing techniques are advantageous. In this study, we investigated the potential of combining Sentinel-2 and Worldview-2 data to classify eight land cover classes in a mangrove ecosystem in Iran with an area of 768 km2. The upscaling approach comprises (i) extraction of reflectance values from Worldview-2 images, (ii) segmentation based on spectral and spatial features, and (iii) wall-to-wall prediction of the land cover based on Sentinel-2 images. We used an upscaling approach to minimize the costs of commercial satellite images for collecting reference data and to focus on freely available satellite data for mapping land cover classes of mangrove ecosystems. The approach resulted in a 65.5{\%} overall accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 0.63, and it produced the highest accuracies for deep water and closed mangrove canopy cover. Mapping accuracies improved with this approach, resulting in medium overall accuracy even though the user's accuracy of some classes, such as tidal zone and shallow water, was low. Conservation and sustainable management in these ecosystems can be improved in the future.},

abstract = {Global mangrove loss has been attributed primarily to human activity. Anthropogenic loss hotspots across Southeast Asia and around the world have characterized the ecosystem as highly threatened, though natural processes such as erosion can also play a significant role in forest vulnerability. However, the extent of human and natural threats has not been fully quantified at the global scale. Here, using a Random Forest-based analysis of over one million Landsat images, we present the first 30 m resolution global maps of the drivers of mangrove loss from 2000 to 2016, capturing both human-driven and natural stressors. We estimate that 62{\%} of global losses between 2000 and 2016 resulted from land-use change, primarily through conversion to aquaculture and agriculture. Up to 80{\%} of these human-driven losses occurred within six Southeast Asian nations, reflecting the regional emphasis on enhancing aquaculture for export to support economic development. Both anthropogenic and natural losses declined between 2000 and 2016, though slower declines in natural loss caused an increase in their relative contribution to total global loss area. We attribute the decline in anthropogenic losses to the regionally dependent combination of increased emphasis on conservation efforts and a lack of remaining mangroves viable for conversion. While efforts to restore and protect mangroves appear to be effective over decadal timescales, the emergence of natural drivers of loss presents an immediate challenge for coastal adaptation. We anticipate that our results will inform decision-making within conservation and restoration initiatives by providing a locally relevant understanding of the causes of mangrove loss.},

@techreport{Burke2008,
abstract = {Executive Summary The economic benefits derived from coral reefs are vital to the economies of small island states in the Caribbean. Economic valuation of these benefits helps to guide the wise, sustainable use of these resources. Coral reefs provide many benefits, sometimes called ecosystem goods and services, which are of high value and critical importance to local and national economies in the Caribbean. These values are frequently overlooked or underappreciated in coastal investment, development and policy decisions, resulting in short-sighted decisions that do not maximize the long-term economic potential of coastal areas. This project focuses on development of a valuation methodology that will be broadly applicable in countries across the Caribbean, supporting wise, long-term coastal policy and management. This report provides a comprehensive summary of the valuation methodology as well as valuation results from implementation in two pilot sites in the Eastern Caribbean (St. Lucia and Tobago). Shorter, island- specific summaries of results, along with an Excel-based Valuation Tool for implementing the methodology are available from www.wri.org/project/valuation-caribbean-reefs. Estimating the economic benefits of coral reefs to local economies is neither easy nor straightforward, due to the range of approaches available and frequent limitations of underlying data. Many valuation methods exist, and results are rarely comparable. A priority for this project has been the development of a simple, broadly applicable methodology to value coral reef goods and services, based predominantly on commonly available data. Use of a consistent approach should lead to more comparable estimates of value for different places and time periods. An easily replicable methodology can also be applied while varying key assumptions in order to assess the impacts of different development and management options. This methodology does not assess Total Economic Value (TEV), but rather focuses on three key goods and services: coral reef-associated tourism, fisheries, and shoreline protection services. These goods and services were chosen because of their importance to local economies and because data are available to support estimation of these values. The method was developed based on literature review, feedback from local partners and examination of coral reef use and data availability in two pilot locations (St. Lucia and Tobago). The results from the economic valuation of coral reefs in St. Lucia and Tobago—sites with very different coastal management and data richness situations—are presented below. Even assessing only a subset of goods and services demonstrates that the benefits provided by coral reefs are economically significant, particularly with respect to island GDP. These estimates should be viewed as lower bound (partial) estimates of the economic contribution of coral reefs to the economy of these two islands. The economic impact of coral reef-associated tourism and recreation and fisheries is evaluated using a financial analysis method—tracking the financial flows generated by these two industries, and their wider impact on the economy. Shoreline protection services are evaluated using a modified avoided damages approach, where the value of a reduction in wave-induced erosion and property damage due to coral reefs is estimated. The methodology, as well as the Valuation Tool, uses a tiered approach, allowing results to be calculated at different levels of detail depending upon the data available.},

abstract = {Evolving climate conditions and anthropogenic factors, such as CO2 emissions, urbanization and population growth, can cause changes in weather and climate extremes. Most current risk assessment models rely on the assumption of stationarity (i.e., no temporal change in statistics of extremes). Most nonstationary modeling studies focus primarily on changes in extremes over time. Here, we present Process-informed Nonstationary Extreme Value Analysis (ProNEVA) as a generalized tool for incorporating different types of physical drivers (i.e., underlying processes), stationary and nonstationary concepts, and extreme value analysis methods (i.e., annual maxima, peak-over-threshold). ProNEVA builds upon a newly-developed hybrid evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for numerical parameters estimation and uncertainty assessment. This offers more robust uncertainty estimates of return periods of climatic extremes under both stationary and nonstationary assumptions. ProNEVA is designed as a generalized tool allowing using different types of data and nonstationarity concepts physically-based or purely statistical) into account. In this paper, we show a wide range of applications describing changes in: annual maxima river discharge in response to urbanization, annual maxima sea levels over time, annual maxima temperatures in response to CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, and precipitation with a peak-over-threshold approach. ProNEVA is freely available to the public and includes a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enhance its implementation.},

abstract = {Satellite imagery offers an efficient and cost-effective means of estimating water depth in shallow environments. However, traditional empirical algorithms for calculating water depth often are unable to account for varying bottom reflectance, and therefore yield biased estimates for certain benthic environments. We present a simple method that is grounded in the physics of radiative transfer in seawater, but made more robust through the calibration of individual color-to-depth relationships for separate spectral classes. Our cluster-based regression (CBR) algorithm, applied to a portion of the Great Bahama Bank, drastically reduces the geographic structure in the residual and has a mean absolute error of 0.19 m with quantified uncertainties. Our CBR bathymetry is 3–5 times more accurate than existing models and outperforms machine learning protocols at extrapolating beyond the calibration data. Finally, we demonstrate how comparison of CBR with traditional models sensitive to bottom type reveals the characteristic length scales of biosedimentary facies belts.},

Researchers have started to evaluate the costs and benefits of flood adaptation, but information regarding the cost of different flood adaptation measures is often not available or is hidden in non-peer-reviewed literature. Recent review studies have explored cost estimates for different aspects of flood adaptation, such as nature-based solutions. This study aims to contribute empirical data regarding the cost of flood adaptation by compiling peer-reviewed literature and research reports. The focus is on construction costs and expenses for operation and maintenance. This paper integrates the unit cost information of six main flood adaptation measure categories: (1) the flood-proofing of buildings, (2) flood protection, (3) beach nourishment and dunes, (4) nature-based solutions for coastal ecosystems, (5) channel management and nature-based solutions for riverine systems, and (6) urban drainage. Cost estimates are corrected for inflation and converted to U.S. dollars (2016). Measures are described, and cost figures for both developed and developing countries are provided. The results of this study can be used as input for economic-assessment studies on flood adaptation measures.},

abstract = {Most studies of nearshore hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and morphology focus on bathymetric variability within a narrow band of spatial and temporal scales. Typically, these studies rely on bathymetry estimates derived from field observations consisting of discrete samples in space and time with varying degrees of measurement error. Sampling limitations, which result in aliasing, and measurement errors can significantly contaminate variability at resolved scales, and may lead to large errors in the representation of the scales of interest. Using a spectral analysis, interpolation errors were analyzed for three different nearshore bathymetric data sets, each of which targeted a different range of spatial scales. Bathymetric features that were unresolved or poorly resolved (e.g. beach cusps) introduced the potential for contamination in two of the data sets. This contamination was significantly reduced using an appropriate scale-controlled interpolation method, leading to more accurate representations of the actual bathymetry. An additional benefit of using scale-controlled interpolation is that interpolation errors may be estimated independently of actual observations, which allows one to design bathymetric sampling strategies that ensure that dominant scales are either resolved or largely removed. Finally, interpolation errors corresponding to a particular sample design can be used to determine which interpolated values contribute usefully to a band-limited analysis of bathymetric variability.},

abstract = {This paper examines and contrasts two estimation methods, Kalman filtering and linear smoothing, for creating interpolated data products from bathymetry measurements. Using targeted examples, we demonstrate previously obscured behavior showing the dependence of linear smoothers on the spatial arrangement of the measurements, yielding markedly different estimation results than the Kalman filter. For bathymetry data, we have modified the variance estimates from both the Kalman filter and linear smoothers to obtain comparable estimators for dense data. These comparable estimators produce uncertainty estimates that have statistically insignificant differences via hypothesis testing. Achieving comparable estimation is accomplished by applying the “propagated uncertainty” concept and a numerical realization of Tobler's principle to the measurement data prior to the computation of the estimate. We show new mathematical derivations for these modifications. In addition, we show test results with (a) synthetic data and (b) gridded bathymetry in the area of the Scripps and La Jolla Canyons. Our tenfold cross-validation for case (b) shows that the modified equations create comparable uncertainty for both gridding algorithms with null hypothesis acceptance rates of greater than 99.95{\%} of the data points. In contrast, bilinear interpolation has 10 times the amount of rejection. We then discuss how the uncertainty estimators are, in principle, applicable to interpolate geophysical data other than bathymetry.},

abstract = {Mangroves have been suggested as an eco-defense strategy to dissipate tsunamis, storm surges, and king tides. As such, efforts have increased to replant forests along coasts that are vulnerable to flooding. The leafy canopies, stems, and aboveground root structures of mangroves limit water exchange across a forest, reducing flood amplitudes. The attenuation of long waves in mangroves was measured using cross-shore transects of pressure sensors in two contrasting environments in New Zealand, both characterized by mono-specific cultures of grey mangroves (Avicennia marina) and approximate cross-shore widths of 1 km. The first site, in the Firth of Thames, was characterized by mangrove trees with heights between 0.5 and 3 m, and pneumatophore roots with an average height of 0.2 m, and no substantial tidal drainage channels. Attenuation was measured during storm surge conditions. In this environment, the tidal and surge currents had no alternative pathway than to be forced into the high-drag mangrove vegetation. Observations showed that much of the dissipation occurred at the seaward fringe of the forest, with an average attenuation rate of 0.24 m/km across the forest width. The second site, in Tauranga harbor, was characterized by shorter mangroves between 0.3 and 1.2 m in height and deeply incised drainage channels. No attenuation of the flood tidal wave across the mangrove forest was measurable. Instead, flow preferentially propagated along the unvegetated low-drag channels, reaching the back of the forest much more efficiently than in the Firth of Thames. Our observations from sites with the same vegetation type suggest that mangrove properties are important to long wave dissipation only if water transport through the vegetation is a dominant mechanism of fluid transport. Therefore, realistic predictions of potential coastal protection should be made prior to extensive replanting efforts.},

Remote sensing techniques provide measurements of the basin topography, drainage system, and channel width; however current methods for estimating riverbed elevation are not as accurate. This paper presents methods of altimetry data assimilation (DA) for estimating effective bathymetry of a hydrodynamic model. We tested past altimetry observations from satellites ENVISAT, ICESAT, and JASON 2 and synthetic altimetry data from satellites ICESAT 2, JASON 3, SARAL, and Surface Water and Ocean Topography to assess future/present mission's potential. The DA methods used were direct insertion, linear interpolation, the Shuffled Complex Evolution-University of Arizona optimization algorithm, and an adapted Kalman filter developed with hydraulically based variance and covariance introduced in this paper. The past satellite altimetry DA was evaluated comparing simulated and observed water surface elevation while the synthetic altimetry DA were assessed through a direct comparison with a true bathymetry. The Shuffled Complex Evolution-University of Arizona and hydraulically based Kalman filter methods presented the best performances, reducing water surface elevation error in 65{\%} in past altimetry data experiment and reducing biased bathymetry error in 75{\%} in the synthetic experiment; however, the latter method is much less computationally expensive. Regarding satellites, it was observed that the performance is related to the satellite intertrack distance, as higher number of observation sites allows more accurate bed elevation estimation.},

abstract = {Mangroves are valuable coastal habitats that are globally under pressure due to climate change and coastal development. Small-scale physical disturbance by tidal inundation and wave-induced sediment dynamics has been described as the main bottlenecks to mangrove seedling establishment on exposed tidal flats. However, such biophysical bottlenecks remain poorly studied.Mangrove progradation at our study site at the Firth of Thames (New Zealand) has been described as rapid but disturbance limited. For this site, we apply a mechanistic model according to the 'Window of Opportunity' (WoO) concept, which analyses real time series of external forcing for disturbance free periods. The model was parameterized with manipulative experiments on seedling stability and monitoring data. The modelled inundation free periods for initial anchoring were validated by a caging experiment with loose and tethered propagules.Although the time series of external forcing derived from monitoring data are simplified, our model confirms the absence of mangrove progradation due to failed recruitment events on the tidal flat since 1997. The model also shows, that a temporary reduction in external forcing would lead to a sudden progradation of the mangrove forest.WoO dynamics, where vegetation establishment requires temporarily benign conditions, may be of general importance to other ecosystems with stochastic external forcing. Understanding the biophysical interactions between vegetation and geomorphic processes is key to better manage and protect disturbance-driven ecosystems in times of changing wind pattern and accelerated sea-level rise.},

abstract = {The results of absolute satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) are presented in the current study. A comparative analysis was conducted on empirical methods in order to explore the potential of SDB in shallow water on the coast of Misano, Italy. Operations were carried out by relying on limited in situ water depth data to extract and calibrate bathymetry from a QuickBird satellite image acquired on a highly dynamic coastal environment. The image was processed using the log-band ratio and optimal band ratio analysis (OBRA) methods. Preprocessing steps included the conversion of the raw satellite image into top of atmosphere reflectance, spatial filtering, land and water classification, the determination of the optimal OBRA spectral band pairs, and the estimation of relative SDB. Furthermore, calibration and vertical referencing were performed via in situ bathymetry acquired in November 2007. The relative bathymetry obtained from different band ratios were vertically referenced to the local datum using in situ water depth in order to obtain absolute SDB. The coefficient of determination (R2) and vertical root mean square error (RMSE) were computed for each method. A strong correlation with in situ field bathymetry was observed for both methods, with R2 = 0.8682 and RMSE = 0.518 m for the log-band ratio method and R2 = 0.8927{\&}ndash;0.9108 and RMSE = 0.35 m for the OBRA method. This indicated a high degree of confidence of the SDB results obtained for the study area, with a high performance of the OBRA method for SDB mapping in turbid water.},

The assessment showed that (1) radiative-transfer-based methods were more accurate than the empirical approach for bathymetric retrieval, and the accuracies and processing times were inversely related to the complexity of the models used; (2) all inversion methods provided moderately accurate retrievals of bathymetry, water column inherent optical properties, and benthic reflectance in waters less than 13 m deep with homogeneous to heterogeneous benthic/substrate covers; (3) slightly higher accuracy retrievals were obtained from locally parameterized methods; and (4) no method compared here can be considered optimal for all situations. The results provide a guide to the conditions where each approach may be used (available image and field data and processing capability). A re-analysis of these same or additional sites with satellite hyperspectral data with lower spatial and radiometric resolution, but higher temporal resolution would be instructive to establish guidelines for repeatable regional to global scale shallow water mapping approaches. {\textcopyright} 2011, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a) is a great indicator for estimating phytoplankton biomass and productivity levels and is also particularly useful for monitoring the water quality, biodiversity and species distribution, and harmful algal blooms. A great deal of studies investigated to estimate chl-a concentrations using ocean color remotely sensed data. With the development of photon-counting sensors, spaceborne photon-counting lidar can compensate for the shortcomings of passive optical remote sensing by enabling ocean vertical profiling in low-light conditions (e.g., at night). Using geolocated photons captured by the first spaceborne photon-counting lidar borne on ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2), this research reported methods for deriving vertical profiles of chl-a concentration in the upper layer of ocean waters. This study first calculates the average numbers of backscattered subaqueous photons of ICESat-2 at different water depths, and then estimates the optical parameters in water column based on a discrete theoretical model of the expected number of received signal photons. With the estimated optical parameters, vertical profiles of chl-a concentration are calculated by two different empirical algorithms. In two study areas (mostly with Type I open ocean waters and small part of Type II coastal ocean waters), the derived chl-a concentrations are generally consistent when validated by BGC-Argo (Biogeochemical Argo) data in the vertical direction (MAPEs{\textless}15{\&}{\#}x0025;) and compared with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data in the along-track direction (average R2{\textgreater}0.86). Using globally covered ICESat-2 data, this approach can be used to obtain vertical profiles of chl-a concentration and optical parameters at a larger scale, which will be helpful to analyze impact factors of climate change and human activities on subsurface phytoplankton species and their growth state.},

abstract = {Large areas of the world's coastal marine environments remain poorly characterized because they have not been mapped with sufficient accuracy and at spatial resolutions high enough to support a wide range of societal needs. Expediting the rate of seafloor mapping requires the collection of multi-use datasets that concurrently address hydrographic charting needs and support decision-making in ecosystem-based management. While active optical and acoustic sensors have previously been compared for the purpose of hydrographic charting, few studies have evaluated the performance and cost effectiveness of these systems for providing benthic habitat maps. Bathymetric and intensity data were collected in shallow water ({\textless} 50 m depth) coral reef ecosystems using two conventional remote sensing technologies: (1) airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and (2) ship-based multibeam (MBES) Sound Navigation and Ranging (SoNAR). A comparative assessment using a suite of twelve metrics demonstrated that LiDAR and MBES were equally capable of discriminating seafloor topography (r = {\textgreater} 0.9), although LiDAR depths were found to be consistently shallower than MBES depths. The intensity datasets were not significantly correlated at a broad 4 × 5 km spatial scale (r = - 0.11), but were moderately correlated in flat areas at a fine 4 × 500 m spatial scale (r = 0.51), indicating that the LiDAR intensity algorithm needs to be improved before LiDAR intensity surfaces can be used for habitat mapping. LiDAR cost 6.6{\%} less than MBES and required 40 fewer hours to map the same study area. MBES provided more detail about the seafloor by fully ensonifying high-relief features, by differentiating between fine and coarse sediments and by collecting data with higher spatial resolutions. Surface fractal dimensions and fast Fourier transformations emerged as useful methods for detecting artifacts in the datasets. Overall, LiDAR provided a more cost effective alternative to MBES for mapping and monitoring shallow water coral reef ecosystems ({\textless} 50 m depth), although the unique advantages of MBES may make it a more appropriate choice for answering certain ecological or geological questions requiring very high resolution data. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

We start with a brief overview about mangrove ecosystems while showing various aspects of hydro- and sediment dynamics without claiming exhaustiveness. Since mangrove structures are commonly mimicked using cylindrical stems, papers presenting flow and sedimentation patterns around cylinders are also included in this chapter. We report a significant gap of knowledge of hydrodynamics and sediment transport around mangrove structures at small spatial scales of root systems or trees, single roots or seedlings, and surface texture. To date, most studies are based on field measurements investigating sediment transport around mangrove structures, followed by investigations using flume experiments or numerical simulations. However, Computational Fluid Dynamics appears to be a method with great potential to quantify small-scale dynamics around mangrove structures and could lead to a better understanding of these ecosystems and their processes.},

Fortunately, additional and unrealized information from the penetration of laser light below the ocean's surface offers a new and exciting opportunity to study ocean biology over the open sea water and below sea ice. We have proposed a novel algorithm to determine ocean subsurface optical properties, such as, diffuse attenuated coefficient, kd (/m), total backscattering coefficients bb (/m), and layerintegrated ocean subsurface backscatter from ICESat-2/ATLAS lidar measurements. Our ICESat-2 ocean subsurface results reveal high vertical resolution through the water column that have been hidden in the ocean color record from passive sensors.

abstract = {Terrestrial carbon stock mapping is important for the successful implementation of climate change mitigation policies. Its accuracy depends on the availability of reliable allometric models to infer oven-dry aboveground biomass of trees from census data. The degree of uncertainty associated with previously published pantropical aboveground biomass allometries is large. We analyzed a global database of directly harvested trees at 58 sites, spanning a wide range of climatic conditions and vegetation types (4004 trees ≥ 5 cm trunk diameter). When trunk diameter, total tree height, and wood specific gravity were included in the aboveground biomass model as covariates, a single model was found to hold across tropical vegetation types, with no detectable effect of region or environmental factors. The mean percent bias and variance of this model was only slightly higher than that of locally fitted models. Wood specific gravity was an important predictor of aboveground biomass, especially when including a much broader range of vegetation types than previous studies. The generic tree diameter–height relationship depended linearly on a bioclimatic stress variable E, which compounds indices of temperature variability, precipitation variability, and drought intensity. For cases in which total tree height is unavailable for aboveground biomass estimation, a pantropical model incorporating wood density, trunk diameter, and the variable E outperformed previously published models without height. However, to minimize bias, the development of locally derived diameter–height relationships is advised whenever possible. Both new allometric models should contribute to improve the accuracy of biomass assessment protocols in tropical vegetation types, and to advancing our understanding of architectural and evolutionary constraints on woody plant development.},

Mangroves vary substantially according to their geomorphic and sedimentary setting; while several conceptual frameworks describe these settings, their spatial distribution has not been quantified. Here, we present a new global mangrove biophysical typology and show that, based on their 2016 extent, 40.5{\%} (54,972 km2) of mangrove systems were deltaic, 27.5{\%} (37,411 km2) were estuarine and 21.0{\%} (28,493 km2) were open coast, with lagoonal mangroves the least abundant (11.0{\%}, 14,993 km2). Mangroves were also classified based on their sedimentary setting, with carbonate mangroves being less abundant than terrigenous, representing just 9.6{\%} of global coverage. Our typology provides a basis for future research to incorporate geomorphic and sedimentary setting in analyses. We present two examples of such applications. Firstly, based on change in extent between 1996 and 2016, we show while all types exhibited considerable declines in area, losses of lagoonal mangroves (− 6.9{\%}) were nearly twice that of other types. Secondly, we quantify differences in aboveground biomass between mangroves of different types, with it being significantly lower in lagoonal mangroves. Overall, our biophysical typology provides a baseline for assessing restoration potential and for quantifying mangrove ecosystem service provision.},

Visualizing origin-destination flows is challenging mainly due to visual clutter which appears quickly as data sets grow. Clutter reduction techniques are intensively explored in the information visualization and cartography domains. However, current automatic techniques for origin-destination flow visualization, such as edge bundling, are not available in geographic information systems which are widely used to visualize spatial data, such as origin-destination flows. In this article, we explore the applicability of edge bundling to spatial data sets and necessary adaptations under the constraints inherent to platform-independent geographic information system scripting environments. We propose (1) a new clustering technique for origin-destination flows that provides within-cluster consistency to speed up computations, (2) an edge bundling approach based on force-directed edge bundling employing matrix computations, (3) a new technique to determine the local strength of a bundle leveraging spatial indexes, and (4) a geographic information system-based technique to spatially offset bundles describing different flow directions. Finally, we evaluate our method by applying it to origin-destination flow data sets with a wide variety of different data characteristics.},

This study aims were to investigate the potential use of laser photon data of ICESat-2 for geomorphic mapping and reef rugosity indication. About eight tracks of data photon of Kapoposang island and four tracks of Kodingarenglompo were investigated to indicate the existence of coral reef and its geomorphic zone. The results show that the photon's depth for Kapoposang island is easier to interpret than Kadingarenglompo due to the clarity of the water column. The deepest depth photon achieves for Kapoposang reef was up to 17 meters while at Kodingarenglompo just about 6 meters. The depth photon variability at reef area is significantly different from sand and submerged vegetation area. The depth dan slope variability are easy to detect using this lidar altimetry which in turn very helpful on classifying the geomorphic zone of reef habitat. Hence these results may lead to study more about the use of ICESat-2 data for reef habitat mapping.},

A photon-counting lidar onboard ICESat-2 yields point clouds resulting from surface returns and noise. In support of the ICESat-2 mission, this letter derives an adaptive density-based model that is capable of detecting the ground surface and vegetation canopy in photon-counting laser altimeter data. Based on results from point clouds generated by a first principle simulation and those observed by the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar, the ground and canopy returns can be reliably extracted using the proposed approach. Further study on performance assessment shows that smoother surfaces will result in improved accuracy of ground height estimation. In addition, the proposed detection approach has better performance in environments with lower noise, although the performance evaluation metric F-measure does not vary significantly over a range of noise rates (0.5-5 MHz). This proposed approach is generally applicable for surface and canopy finding from photon-counting laser altimeter data.},

abstract = {This paper describes benchmark testing of a diffusive and an inertial formulation of the de St. Venant equations implemented within the LISFLOOD-FP hydraulic model using high resolution terrestrial LiDAR data. The models are applied to a hypothetical flooding scenario in a section of Alcester, UK which experienced significant surface water flooding in the June and July floods of 2007 in the UK. The sensitivity of water elevation and velocity simulations to model formulation and grid resolution are analyzed. The differences in depth and velocity estimates between the diffusive and inertial approximations are within 10{\%} of the simulated value but inertial effects persist at the wetting front in steep catchments. Both models portray a similar scale dependency between 50. cm and 5. m resolution which reiterates previous findings that errors in coarse scale topographic data sets are significantly larger than differences between numerical approximations. In particular, these results confirm the need to distinctly represent the camber and curbs of roads in the numerical grid when simulating surface water flooding events. Furthermore, although water depth estimates at grid scales coarser than 1. m appear robust, velocity estimates at these scales seem to be inconsistent compared to the 50. cm benchmark. The inertial formulation is shown to reduce computational cost by up to three orders of magnitude at high resolutions thus making simulations at this scale viable in practice compared to diffusive models. For the first time, this paper highlights the utility of high resolution terrestrial LiDAR data to inform small-scale flood risk management studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Whilst global flood risk models exist for this purpose, the accuracy of their results is greatly limited by the lack of information on the current standard of protection to floods, with studies either neglecting this aspect or resorting to crude assumptions. Here we present a first global database of FLOod PROtection Standards, FLOPROS, which comprises information in the form of the flood return period associated with protection measures, at different spatial scales. FLOPROS comprises three layers of information, and combines them into one consistent database. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}design{\textless}/i{\textgreater} layer contains empirical information about the actual standard of existing protection already in place; the {\textless}i{\textgreater}policy{\textless}/i{\textgreater} layer contains information on protection standards from policy regulations; and the {\textless}i{\textgreater}model{\textless}/i{\textgreater} layer uses a validated modelling approach to calculate protection standards. The policy layer and the model layer can be considered adequate proxies for actual protection standards included in the design layer, and serve to increase the spatial coverage of the database. Based on this first version of FLOPROS, we suggest a number of strategies to further extend and increase the resolution of the database. Moreover, as the database is intended to be continually updated, while flood protection standards are changing with new interventions, FLOPROS requires input from the flood risk community.

abstract = {Mangrove restoration has become a popular strategy to ensure the critical functions and economic benefits of this ecosystem. This study conducts a meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed literature on the outcomes of mangrove restoration. On aggregate, restored mangroves provide higher ecosystem functions than unvegetated tidal flats but lower than natural mangrove stands (respectively RR' = 0.43, 95{\%}CIs = 0.23 to 0.63; RR' = -0.21, 95{\%}CIs = -0.34 to -0.08), while they perform on par with naturally-regenerated mangroves and degraded mangroves. However, restoration outcomes vary widely between functions and comparative bases, and are mediated by factors such as restoration age, species, and restoration method. Furthermore, mangrove restoration offers positive benefit-cost ratios ranging from 10.50 to 6.83 under variable discount rates (-2{\%} to 8{\%}), suggesting that mangrove restoration is a cost-effective form of ecosystem management. Overall, the results suggest that mangrove restoration has substantial potential to contribute to multiple policy objectives related to biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and sustainable development.},

@article{Bricheno2016,
abstract = {The finite volume community ocean model (FVCOM) has been applied to the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta in the northern part of the Bay of Bengal in order to simulate tidal hydrodynamics and freshwater flow in a complex river system. The delta region is data-poor in observations of both bathymetry and water level; making it a challenge for accurate hydrodynamic models be configured for and validated in this area. This is the first 3D baroclinic model covering the whole GBM delta from deep water beyond the shelf break to 250 km inland, the limit of tidal penetration. This paper examines what controls tidal penetration from the open coast into an intricate system of river channels. A modelling approach is used to improve understanding of the hydrodynamics of the GBM delta system. Tidal penetration is controlled by a combination of bathymetry, channel geometry, bottom friction, and river flow. The simulated tides must be validated before this delta model is used further to investigate baroclinic processes, river salinity and future change in this area. The performance of FVCOM tidal model configuration is evaluated at a range of sites in order to assess its ability to capture water levels which vary over both a tidal and seasonal cycle. FVCOM is seen to capture the leading tidal constituents well at coastal tide gauge stations, with small root-mean-squared errors of 10 cm on average. Inland, the model compares favourably with twice daily observed water levels at thirteen stations where it is able to capture both tidal and annual timescales in the estuarine system. When the river discharge is particularly strong, the tidal range can be reduced as the tide and river are in direct competition. The bathymetry is found to be the most influential control on water levels within the delta, though tidal penetration can be significantly affected by the model's bottom roughness, and the inclusion of large river discharge. We discuss the generic problem of implementing a model in a data-poor region and the challenge of validating a hydrodynamic model from the open coast to narrow river channels.},

Common flood hazard assessment practices typically focus on one flood driver at a time and ignore potential compounding impacts. Here we outline a unique bivariate flood hazard assessment framework that accounts for the interactions between a primary oceanic flooding hazard, coastal water level, and fluvial flooding hazards. Using the notion of “failure probability,” we also assess coastal flood hazard under different future sea level rise scenarios. The results show that, in a warming climate, future sea level rise not only increases the failure probability, but also exacerbates the compounding effects of flood drivers.},

@article{Winterwerp2005a,
abstract = {This pilot study describes an analysis of the erosion processes of the Bang Khun Thien mangrove mud coast situated at the Upper Gulf of Thailand, and discusses measures to stop this erosion process and to rehabilitate the area. The rapid erosion observed is the result of the decimation in intertidal area by the dikes directly behind the coastline, constructed to protect the fish and shrimp ponds in the coastal area. The decrease in sediment yield from the Chao Phraya River as a result of the construction of the Bhumipol and Sirikit dams, and the local subsidence due to ground water withdrawal and natural settling will augment the observed coastal erosion, but at a much smaller rate. The latter effects are expected to become important on a time scale of about a hundred years only. The key to stop the erosion processes and rehabilitate the area is therefore the restoration of the intertidal area. This can be done either entirely within the current coastline, but by sacrificing part of the fish and shrimp ponds, or partly within the current coastline and partly in the coastal zone, i.e. in the coastal area recently lost. In the latter case, the coastal area has to be protected from lateral transport of sediment by permeable groynes perpendicular to the coast. It is estimated that an intertidal mangrove belt of about 300 to 500 m is required to re-initiate sedimentation processes, hence to restore a favourable habitat for mangrove forest.},

The analysis is based on tests on structures with a 1:100 foreshore and a 1:30 foreshore. It has been found that especially for applications with shallow foreshores the formulae by Van der Meer (1988) can better be applied a) by using the spectral wave period T m-1,0 instead of the mean wave period Tm from time-domain analysis, b) by re-calibrating the coefficients, and c) by adapting the confidence levels.

abstract = {This research is focused on determining the contribution to the precession of the Earth's equator due to the mass redistribution stemming from the gravitational action of the Moon and the Sun on a rotating solid Earth. In the IAU2006 precession theory, this effect is taken into account through a contribution of −0.960 mas cy{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for the precession in longitude (with the unspecific name of non-linear effect). In this work, the revised value of that second-order contribution reaches −37.847 mas cy{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} when using the Love numbers values given in IERS Conventions, and −43.945 mas cy{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} if those values are supplemented with the contributions of the oceanic tides. Such variations impose a change of the first-order precession value that induces relative changes of the Earth's dynamical ellipticity of about 7.3 and 8.5 ppm, respectively. The corresponding values for the obliquity rate are 0.0751 and 0.9341 mas cy{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, respectively, in contrast to 0.340 mas cy{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} considered in IAU2006. The fundamentals of the modeling have been revisited by giving a clear construction of the redistribution potential of the Earth through the corresponding changes in the Earth tensor of inertia. The dynamical problem is tackled within the Hamiltonian framework of a two-layer Earth model, introduced and developed by Getino and Ferr{\'{a}}ndiz. This approach allows for the achievement of closed-analytical formulae for the precession in longitude and obliquity. It makes it possible to obtain numerical values for different Earth models once a set of associated Love numbers is selected.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}NASA's Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) was launched in September, 2018. The satellite carries a single instrument, ATLAS (Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System), a green wavelength, photon-counting lidar, enabling global measurement and monitoring of elevation with a primary focus on the cryosphere. Although bathymetric mapping was not one of the design goals for ATLAS, pre-launch work by our research team showed the potential to map bathymetry with ICESat-2, using data from MABEL (Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar), NASA's high-altitude airborne ATLAS emulator, and adapting the laser-radar equation for ATLAS specific parameters. However, many of the sensor variables were only approximations, which limited a full assessment of the bathymetric mapping capabilities of ICESat-2 during pre-launch studies. Following the successful launch, preliminary analyses of the geolocated photon returns have been conducted for a number of coastal sites, revealing several salient examples of seafloor detection in water depths of up to {\~{}}40 m. The geolocated seafloor photon returns cannot be taken as bathymetric measurements, however, since the algorithm used to generate them is not designed to account for the refraction that occurs at the air–water interface or the corresponding change in the speed of light in the water column. This paper presents the first early on-orbit validation of ICESat-2 bathymetry and quantification of the bathymetric mapping performance of ATLAS using data acquired over St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. A refraction correction, developed and tested in this work, is applied, after which the ICESat-2 bathymetry is compared against high-accuracy airborne topo-bathymetric lidar reference data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The results show agreement to within 0.43—0.60 m root mean square error (RMSE) over 1 m grid resolution for these early on-orbit data. Refraction-corrected bottom return photons are then inspected for four coastal locations around the globe in relation to Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Kd(490) data to empirically determine the maximum depth mapping capability of ATLAS as a function of water clarity. It is demonstrated that ATLAS has a maximum depth mapping capability of nearly 1 Secchi in depth for water depths up to 38 m and Kd(490) in the range of 0.05–0.12 m−1. Collectively, these results indicate the great potential for bathymetric mapping with ICESat-2, offering a promising new tool to assist in filling the global void in nearshore bathymetry.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Despite its critical importance to carbon storage modeling, forest vertical structure remains poorly characterized over large areas. Canopy height estimates from current satellite missions such as ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) offer promise to close this knowledge gap, but their validation is critically important to inform their measurement uncertainties and scientific utility. Using existing airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, the agreement of a variety of terrain and aboveground canopy height metrics including summary height statistics and percentiles, from ICESat-2' Land, Water and Vegetation Elevation product (ATL08) product was assessed in 12 sites across six major biomes in the United States. The agreement between ATL08 and ALS heights was assessed using the mean bias (Bias, ATL08 – ALS), the mean absolute error (MAE) and their percent equivalents, percent bias (pBias) and percent MAE (pMAE), respectively. In general, the agreement between ATL08 and ALS terrain heights was high (Bias 0.18 m, pBias 0.1{\%}) while canopy heights showed lower agreement (Bias −1.71 m, pBias −15.9{\%}). Analyses by biome, time of acquisition and beam strength of the ICESat-2 photon data also showed generally higher agreement for ATL08 terrain than canopy heights. Analyses also showed the performance of ATL08 heights varied with canopy cover with ATL08 terrain heights showing the best agreement when canopy cover was between 40 and 70{\%} while the best performance for ATL08 canopy heights was observed when canopy cover was greater than 80{\%}. This observation, coupled with analyses by biome, indicate that ATL08 canopy heights are more suitable in relatively dense canopy environments such as conifer and broadleaf forests than relatively sparse environments such a temperate grassland and Savannas. Higher level canopy height percentiles (95th and 98th) showed higher agreement (mean Bias −12.5{\%}) with ALS heights than lower percentiles (minimum, 25th, mean pBias {\~{}}39.2{\%}). These findings indicate that ATL08 canopy heights show more promise for routine canopy height characterization using the 95th and 98{\%} percentiles but is limited in characterizing intermediate vertical structure. The observed performance differences between ATL08 terrain and canopy heights are attributed to differences in photon sampling rates over terrain and canopy surfaces which, compounded with background noise in ICESat-2 photon data, led to different effectiveness for ATL08 processing routines in filtering terrain and off-terrain points. This assessment of the impact of a variety of factors provides the vegetation community with an understanding of the capabilities and limitations of height estimates from the ICESat-2 ATL08 product.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates a globally applicable method for monitoring mangrove forest extent at high spatial resolution. A 2010 mangrove baseline was classified for 16 study areas using a combination of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat composite imagery within a random forests classifier. A novel map-to-image change method was used to detect annual and decadal changes in extent using ALOS PALSAR/JERS-1 imagery. The map-to-image method presented makes fewer assumptions of the data than existing methods, is less sensitive to variation between scenes due to environmental factors (e.g., tide or soil moisture) and is able to automatically identify a change threshold. Change maps were derived from the 2010 baseline to 1996 using JERS-1 SAR and to 2007, 2008 and 2009 using ALOS PALSAR. This study demonstrated results for 16 known hotspots of mangrove change distributed globally, with a total mangrove area of 2,529,760 ha. The method was demonstrated to have accuracies consistently in excess of 90{\%} (overall accuracy: 92.2–93.3{\%}, kappa: 0.86) for mapping baseline extent. The accuracies of the change maps were more variable and were dependent upon the time period between images and number of change features. Total change from 1996 to 2010 was 204,850 ha (127,990 ha gain, 76,860 ha loss), with the highest gains observed in French Guiana (15,570 ha) and the highest losses observed in East Kalimantan, Indonesia (23,003 ha). Changes in mangrove extent were the consequence of both natural and anthropogenic drivers, yielding net increases or decreases in extent dependent upon the study site. These updated maps are of importance to the mangrove research community, particularly as the continual updating of the baseline with currently available and anticipated spaceborne sensors. It is recommended that mangrove baselines are updated on at least a 5-year interval to suit the requirements of policy makers.},

abstract = {Coastal regions are undergoing rapid change, due to natural and anthropogenic forcings. A current constraint in understanding and modeling these changes is the lack of multi-temporal bathymetric data, or recursive observations. Often, it is difficult to obtain the repeat observations needed to quantify bathymetric change over time or events. However, the recent availability of ICESat-2 bathymetric lidar creates the option to map coastal bathymetry from solely space-based measurements via satellite-derived bathymetry with multispectral imagery (IS-2/SDB). This compositional space-based bathymetric mapping technique can assess temporal change along the coasts without other remote sensing or in situ data. However, questions exist as to the accuracy of the technique relative to both quantitative uncertainties and the ability to resolve the spatial patterns of erosion and deposition in the nearshore environment, indicative of geomorphologic change. This paper addresses the concept using data from the Florida panhandle (Northern Gulf of Mexico) collected by Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2 at two epochs to assess the feasibility of using IS-2/SDB for bathymetric change detection at scientifically relevant scales, spatial resolutions and accuracies. The comparison of the satellite-only result is compared to airborne data collected at similar epochs to reveal both quantitatively and qualitatively the utility of this technique.},

abstract = {Selection of areas for restoration should be based on cost-effectiveness analysis to attain the maximum benefit with a limited budget and overcome the traditional ad hoc allocation of funds for restoration projects. Restoration projects need to be planned on the basis of ecological knowledge and economic and social constraints. We devised a novel approach for selecting cost-effective areas for restoration on the basis of biodiversity and potential provision of 3 ecosystem services: carbon storage, water depuration, and coastal protection. We used Marxan, a spatial prioritization tool, to balance the provision of ecosystem services against the cost of restoration. We tested this approach in a mangrove ecosystem in the Caribbean. Our approach efficiently selected restoration areas that at low cost were compatible with biodiversity targets and that maximized the provision of one or more ecosystem services. Choosing areas for restoration of mangroves on the basis carbon storage potential, largely guaranteed the restoration of biodiversity and other ecosystem services.},

abstract = {To develop improved estimates of (i) flooding due to storm surges, and (2) wetland losses due to accelerated sea-level rise, the work of Hoozemans et al. (1993) is extended to a dynamic analysis. It considers the effects of several simultaneously changing factors, including: (1) global sea-level rise and subsidence; (2) increasing coastal population; and (3) improving standards of flood defence (using GNP/capita as an 'ability-to-pay' parameter). The global sea-level rise scenarios are derived from two General Circulation Model (GCM) experiments of the Hadley Centre: (1) the HadCM2 greenhouse gas only ensemble experiment and (2) the more recent HadCM3 greenhouse gas only experiment. In all cases there is a global rise in sea level of about 38 cm from 1990 to the 2080s. No other climate change is considered. Relative to an evolving reference scenario without sea-level rise, this analysis suggests that the number of people flooded by storm surge in a typical year will be more than five times higher due to sea-level rise by the 2080s. Many of these people will experience annual or more frequent flooding, suggesting that the increase in flood frequency will be more than nuisance level and some response (increased protection, migration, etc.) will be required. In absolute terms, the areas most vulnerable to flooding are the southern Mediterranean, Africa, and most particularly, South and South-east Asia where there is a concentration of low-lying populated deltas. However, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean islands and the Pacific Ocean small islands may experience the largest relative increase in flood risk. By the 2080s, sea-level rise could cause the loss of up to 22{\%} of the world's coastal wetlands. When combined with other losSeS due to direct human action, up to 70{\%} of the world's coastal wetlands could be lost by the 2080s, although there is considerable uncertainty. Therefore, sea-level rise would reinforce other adverse trends of wetland loss. The largest losses due to sea-level rise will be around the Mediterranean and Baltic and to a lesser extent on the Atlantic coast of Central and North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean. Collectively, these results show that a relatively small global rise in sea level could have significant adverse impacts if there is no adaptive response. Given the 'commitment to sea-level rise' irrespective of any realistic future emissions policy, there is a need to start strategic planning of appropriate responses now. Given that coastal flooding and wetland loss are already important problems, such planning could have immediate benefits.},

abstract = {The coastal shallow water zone can be a challenging and costly environment in which to acquire bathymetry and other oceanographic data using traditional survey methods. Much of the coastal shallow water zone worldwide remains unmapped using recent techniques and is, therefore, poorly understood. Optical satellite imagery is proving to be a useful tool in predicting water depth in coastal zones, particularly in conjunction with other standard datasets, though its quality and accuracy remains largely unconstrained. A common challenge in any prediction study is to choose a small but representative group of predictors, one of which can be determined as the best. In this respect, exploratory analyses are used to guide the make-up of this group, where we choose to compare a basic non-spatial model versus four spatial alternatives, each catering for a variety of spatial effects. Using one instance of RapidEye satellite imagery, we show that all four spatial models show better adjustments than the non-spatial model in the water depth predictions, with the best predictor yielding a correlation coefficient of actual versus predicted at 0.985. All five predictors also factor in the influence of bottom type in explaining water depth variation. However, the prediction ranges are too large to be used in high accuracy bathymetry products such as navigation charts; nevertheless, they are considered beneficial in a variety of other applications in sensitive disciplines such as environmental monitoring, seabed mapping, or coastal zone management.},

abstract = {Biogenic features such as beaver dams, large wood, and live vegetation are essential to the maintenance of complex stream ecosystems, but these features are largely absent from models of how streams change over time. Many streams have incised because of changing climate or land-use practices. Because incised streams provide limited benefits to biota, they are a common focus of restoration efforts. Contemporary models of long-term change in streams are focused primarily on physical characteristics, and most restoration efforts are also focused on manipulating physical rather than ecological processes. We present an alternative view, that stream restoration is an ecosystem process, and suggest that the recovery of incised streams is largely dependent on the interaction of biogenic structures with physical fluvial processes. In particular, we propose that live vegetation and beaver dams or beaver dam analogues can substantially accelerate the recovery of incised streams and can help create and maintain complex fluvial ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s).},

@article{Leon2014,
abstract = {Coastal managers require reliable spatial data on the extent and timing of potential coastal inundation, particularly in a changing climate. Most sea level rise (SLR) vulnerability assessments are undertaken using the easily implemented bathtub approach, where areas adjacent to the sea and below a given elevation are mapped using a deterministic line dividing potentially inundated from dry areas. This method only requires elevation data usually in the form of a digital elevation model (DEM). However, inherent errors in the DEM and spatial analysis of the bathtub model propagate into the inundation mapping. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of spatially variable and spatially correlated elevation errors in high-spatial resolution DEMs for mapping coastal inundation. Elevation errors were best modelled using regression-kriging. This geostatistical model takes the spatial correlation in elevation errors into account, which has a significant impact on analyses that include spatial interactions, such as inundation modelling. The spatial variability of elevation errors was partially explained by land cover and terrain variables. Elevation errors were simulated using sequential Gaussian simulation, a Monte Carlo probabilistic approach. 1,000 error simulations were added to the original DEM and reclassified using a hydrologically correct bathtub method. The probability of inundation to a scenario combining a 1 in 100 year storm event over a 1 m SLR was calculated by counting the proportion of times from the 1,000 simulations that a location was inundated. This probabilistic approach can be used in a risk-aversive decision making process by planning for scenarios with different probabilities of occurrence. For example, results showed that when considering a 1{\%} probability exceedance, the inundated area was approximately 11{\%} larger than mapped using the deterministic bathtub approach. The probabilistic approach provides visually intuitive maps that convey uncertainties inherent to spatial data and analysis.},

Shallow foreshores considerably affect the evolution of wave height distributions and wave energy spectra between deep water and the toe of coastal structures. The numerical model investigations were performed to study the influence of wave energy spectra on wave runup and wave overtopping. This resulted in a characteristic wave period for wave runup and wave overtopping, which takes the effects of wave energy spectra into account. This was confirmed in a series of physical model tests with different types of foreshores and different types of structures. Also, results from physical model tests were compared with results from measurements in prototype. The six storm conditions that were measured in prototype were accurately reproduced in the physical model tests. The results of each of the three data sources were combined, and led to a prediction method that can be used for conditions with deep water and for conditions with shallow foreshores.},

abstract = {Coastal flood risk assessments require accurate land elevation data. Those to date existed only for limited parts of the world, which has resulted in high uncertainty in projections of land area at risk of sea-level rise (SLR). Here we have applied the first global elevation model derived from satellite LiDAR data. We find that of the worldwide land area less than 2 m above mean sea level, that is most vulnerable to SLR, 649,000 km2 or 62{\%} is in the tropics. Even assuming a low-end relative SLR of 1 m by 2100 and a stable lowland population number and distribution, the 2020 population of 267 million on such land would increase to at least 410 million of which 72{\%} in the tropics and 59{\%} in tropical Asia alone. We conclude that the burden of current coastal flood risk and future SLR falls disproportionally on tropical regions, especially in Asia. Predicting the risk of flooding in coastal environments relies on accurate land elevation data, but this is not available in many parts of the world. Here the authors apply a global lowland digital terrain model derived from satellite LiDAR and determine that the regions most vulnerable to sea-level rise are in the tropics.},

abstract = {Deep learning methods have recently shown a broad application prospect in rainfall-runoff modeling. However, the lack of physical mechanism becomes a major limitation in using machine learning methods that rely on the available labeled observations. To address this issue, the study proposes that synthetic samples are added to train the deep learning network by using three previously undiscussed physical mechanisms as follows: (1) extreme heavy rainfalls when the soil water is saturated, (2) long-duration rainless events when soil water is exhausted, and (3) the monotonic relationship between rainfall and runoff. A physics-guided Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, shortly named PHY-LSTM, is then formulated. PHY-LSTM network is trained on 531 basins of the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset, indicating that the performance is significantly improved compared to conventional LSTM. Specifically, the mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) improves from 0.52 to 0.61 from the daily simulations during the testing period in local models. It is demonstrated that synthetic samples can effectively improve the simulation of flood peaks and reduce the number of negative streamflow, and strong monotonicity is still maintained even if a slight disturbance is involved in the training dataset. The proposed PHY-LSTM shows that physical mechanisms are very useful to improve efficiencies of the data-driven rainfall-runoff model.},

abstract = {The world's coastal areas are increasingly at risk of coastal ﬂooding due to sea-level rise (SLR). We present a novel global dataset of extreme sea levels, the Coastal Dataset for the Evaluation of Climate Impact (CoDEC), which can be used to accurately map the impact of climate change on coastal regions around the world. The third generation Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM), with a coastal resolution of 2.5 km (1.25 km in Europe), was used to simulate extreme sea levels for the ERA5 climate reanalysis from 1979 to 2017, as well as for future climate scenarios from 2040 to 2100. The validation against observed sea levels demonstrated a good performance, and the annual maxima had a mean bias (MB) of -0.04 m, which is 50{\%} lower than the MB of the previous GTSR dataset. By the end of the century (2071–2100), it is projected that the 1 in 10-year water levels will have increased 0.34 m on average for RCP4.5, while some locations may experience increases of up to 0.5 m. The change in return levels is largely driven by SLR, although at some locations changes in storms surges and interaction with tides amplify the impact of SLR with changes up to 0.2 m. By presenting an application of the CoDEC dataset to the city of Copenhagen, we demonstrate how climate impact indicators derived from simulation can contribute to an understanding of climate impact on a local scale. Moreover, the CoDEC output locations are designed to be used as boundary conditions for regional models, and we envisage that they will be used for dynamic downscaling.},

We further do these comparisons in the context of assess the benefits of an ecosystem-based approach for risk reduction. There is growing interest in these ecosystem-based approaches as cost effective measures for adaptation and risk reduction. We assess flood risks from tropical cyclones and the flood risk reduction benefits provided by mangroves in Pagbilao (the Philippines). Then, we also compare risks and risk reduction (benefits) using different quality data and models, to identify where to invest in in new modeling and data acquisition to improve decision-making. We find that coastal flood risk valuation improves by using high resolution topography and long time series of data on tropical cyclones, while flood reduction benefits of mangroves are better valued by using consistent databases and models along the whole process rather than investing in single measures.},

@incollection{Tanaka2011,
abstract = {Tsunamis are one of the most awful natural disasters that can cause catastrophic damage to both human life and socioeconomic property. When a tsunami reaches a coast, it may appear as a rapidly falling or rising tide or a series of breaking waves. When a tsunami reaches the shore, part of the tsunami wave is reflected offshore, but most of it slows down, increases in height, runs up towards the land with huge energy, and causes massive destruction on the coast and in the hinterlands. Mitigation, preparedness, and escape are representative countermeasures to protect human lives and infrastructure facilities from natural hazards. Mitigation techniques are broadly categorized in two ways. These are artificial methods (hard solutions) and natural methods (soft solutions utilizing a natural buffer zone of coastal vegetation, sand dunes, lagoons, or coral reefs). Artificial methods are mainly kinds of sea walls (huge embankments, tsunami gates) that can be constructed on the coastal area for any predicted tsunami height. However, the construction costs of the artificial methods can be very high, which restricts development in many cases. Some developed countries like Japan, which has frequent tsunamis or storm surge threats, have employed such techniques. On the other hand, the use of coastal vegetation as a natural method for disaster mitigation was also discussed in Japan more than 100 years ago (Honda, 1898). Recently, natural methods have been widely understood to reduce the tsunami energy remarkably, although they cannot completely stop the tsunami itself, and their effectiveness depends on the magnitude of the tsunami and the type of vegetation structure (Tanaka et al., 2007). Shuto (1987) analyzed the effects and limitations of coastal vegetation from historical records of tsunamis that occurred in Japan. Especially, since the 1998 Papua New Guinea tsunami (Dengler {\&} Preuss, 2003), many researchers have begun investigating the effects of coastal vegetation on tsunami mitigation using water flume experiments (Harada {\&} Imamura, 2000), field investigations and numerical simulations (Hiraishi {\&} Harada, 2003). After the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004, further research was conducted to elucidate the effectiveness of coastal vegetation (Danielsen et al., 2005; Kathiresan {\&} Rajendran, 2005, 2006; Dahdouh-Guebas et al., 2005; Harada {\&} Imamura, 2006; Tanaka {\&} Sasaki, 2007; Tanaka et al., 2006a, 2006b, 2007; Sasaki et al., 2007; Nandasena et al., 2007) in},

abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness of gradient boosting decision trees techniques in estimating mangrove above-ground biomass (AGB) at the Can Gio biosphere reserve (Vietnam). For this purpose, we employed a novel gradient-boosting regression technique called the extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR) algorithm implemented and verified a mangrove AGB model using data from a field survey of 121 sampling plots conducted during the dry season. The dataset fuses the data of the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) and the dual polarimetric (HH, HV) data of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2. The performance standards of the proposed model (root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coeffcient of determination (R2) were compared with those of other machine learning techniques, namely gradient boosting regression (GBR), support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forests regression (RFR). The XGBR model obtained a promising result with R2 = 0.805, RMSE = 28.13 Mg ha-1, and the model yielded the highest predictive performance among the five machine learning models. In the XGBR model, the estimated mangrove AGB ranged from 11 to 293 Mg ha1 (average = 106.93 Mg ha-1). This work demonstrates that XGBR with the combined Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data can accurately estimate the mangrove AGB in the Can Gio biosphere reserve. The general applicability of the XGBR model combined with multiple sourced optical and SAR data should be further tested and compared in a large-scale study of forest AGBs in different geographical and climatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {The National Coastal Property Model (NCPM) simulates flood damages resulting from sea level rise and storm surge along the contiguous U.S. coastline. The model also projects local-level investments in a set of adaptation measures under the assumption that these measures will be adopted when benefits exceed the costs over a 30-year period. However, it has been observed that individuals and communities often underinvest in adaptive measures relative to standard cost-benefit assumptions due to financial, psychological, sociopolitical, and technological factors. This study applies an updated version of the NCPM to incorporate improved cost-benefit tests and to approximate observed sub-optimal flood risk reduction behavior. The updated NCPM is tested for two multi-county sites: Virginia Beach, VA and Tampa, FL. Sub-optimal adaptation approaches slow the implementation of adaptation measures throughout the 100-year simulation and they increase the amount of flood damages, especially early in the simulation. The net effect is an increase in total present value cost of {\$}1.1 to {\$}1.3 billion (2015 USD), representing about a 10{\%} increase compared to optimal adaptation approaches. Future calibrations against historical data and incorporation of non-economic factors driving adaptation decisions could prove useful in better understanding the impacts of continued sub-optimal behavior.},

abstract = {In large rivers, complex sediment dynamics cause rapid changes in the position and shape of bed deposits. Regular monitoring of changes in river bed geometry is essential for assessing the nature of morphological change and associated bed load during low, high, and medium flow conditions. We demonstrate the application of Direct Sampling (DS) for patching partial river morphological surveys to generate complete maps of the river morphology, by incorporating prior knowledge from bathymetry data collected in different seasons at collocated or adjacent reaches. This novel approach is based on multiple-point statistics (MPS), which uses a training image (TI) to provide prior statistical and architectural constraining data. In this study high and low resolution bathymetry data from a reach of the Mississippi river have been used. High-resolution measurements were conducted using Multi-beam-echo-sounder (MBES), which provides very detailed bed geometry at high spatial resolution. These measurements cannot be acquired at intervals frequent enough to characterize the rapid sedimentological processes. Low resolution bathymetry data can be obtained at frequent intervals but at sparse locations, by installing depth measuring sensors on boats passing the study reach several times a week. The DS method is used to simulate the high resolution bathymetry at the frequency of the low-resolution data. In the simulations, the method uses the bed geometry information contained in the MBES high-resolution surveys, the local information contained in the boat-borne low-resolution measurements, and provides an updated bathymetry map with quantified uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

These important ecosystems are increasingly threatened by human activities and climate change, support both marine and terrestrial biodiversity, and provide critical ecosystem services to coastal communities in Belize and throughout the Mesoamerican Reef ecoregion. Previous national- and international-level inventories document Belizean mangrove forests at spatial resolutions of 30 m or coarser, but many mangrove patches and loss events may be too small to be accurately mapped at these resolutions. Our 10 m map addresses this need for a finer-scale national mangrove inventory. We mapped mangrove ecosystems in Belize as of 2020 by performing a random forest classification of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument imagery in Google Earth Engine. We mapped a total mangrove area of 578.54 km2 in 2020, with 372.04 km2 located on the mainland and 206.50 km2 distributed throughout the country's islands and cayes. Our findings are substantially different from previous, coarser-resolution national mangrove inventories of Belize, which emphasizes the importance of high-resolution mapping efforts for ongoing conservation efforts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Detailed knowledge of the shape of the seafloor is crucial to humankind. Bathymetry data is critical for safety of navigation and is used for many other applications. In an era of ongoing environmental degradation worldwide, bathymetry data (and the knowledge derived from it) play a pivotal role in using and managing the world's oceans in a way that is in accordance with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14-conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. However, the vast majority of our oceans is still virtually unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored. Only a small fraction of the seafloor has been systematically mapped by direct measurement. The remaining bathymetry is predicted from satellite altimeter data, providing only an approximate estimation of the shape of the seafloor. Several global and regional initiatives are underway to change this situation. This paper presents a selection of these initiatives as best practice examples for bathymetry data collection, compilation and open data sharing as well as the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO (The General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans) Seabed 2030 Project that complements and leverages these initiatives and promotes international collaboration and partnership. Several non-traditional data collection opportunities are looked at that are currently gaining momentum as well as new and innovative technologies that can increase the efficiency of collecting bathymetric data. Finally, recommendations are given toward a possible way forward into the future of seafloor mapping and toward achieving the goal of a truly global ocean bathymetry.},

abstract = {Extracting signal photons from noisy raw data is one of the critical processes for the new generation of spaceborne photon-counting laser altimeter. Affected by vast noise photon-counting events, the extraction of weak signal events still faces challenges in complex scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Aiming to improve the extraction ability of signal photon events in these scenarios, a multiscale fusion signal extraction method was proposed, characterized by combining global spatial correlation constraint with optimized local spatial correlation constraint. The local constraint is implemented based on a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering method with adaptive parameter estimation, which is used to extract possible signal photons. A subsequent global constraint based on the spatial correlation of the terrain profiles is designed to remove the pseudo-signal photons clustered in the local constraints' step. The global constraint is implemented based on a cost function, which is used to quantify different candidate paths. Our method was verified based on the actual Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation satellite-(ICESat2) data containing vegetation, mountains, and residential areas. The experimental results show that compared with the ICESat-2 extraction method, our method can significantly improve the precision and recall rate of signal photon events from the low SNR photon-counting data.},

@phdthesis{DeKoning2021,
abstract = {The risk of flood risk is increasing with global trends such as rising sea levels, land subsidence, increasing populations in coastal areas and economic growth. Traditional solutions to reduce flood risk are a levee or a dam; however, the research on hydraulic engineering is increasingly promoting nature-based solutions for flood protection. Salt marshes and mangroves can attenuate waves and could thus help to reduce failure probability. This research focuses on the attractiveness of mangroves in flood risk reduction. The essence of the reasoning followed in this research is that mangroves in front of a levee enable a lower levee and therefore reduce costs while maintaining the same failure probability. There are three aspects related to this assessment: the biological behavior of mangroves; the physical behavior of waves and storm surge in a mangrove forest; and the economics of flood risk, levees, and mangroves. Mangroves grow under specific conditions, such as high temperatures, saline water with fresh water input, between mean sea level and high tide, and with low wave impact. Mangroves attenuate waves, with the attenuation rates depending on mangrove height, stem diameter and density, in addition to the water depth, wave height and wave period. Lastly, the costs of restoring mangroves and building levees have been considered. In this thesis a method has been developed to define the optimal configuration of a levee-mangrove system. The goal is to reach a desired safety level while keeping costs as low as possible. Costs consist of building a levee, restoring mangroves, and the expected annual damage and maintenance. This depends on the ratio of mangrove and levee costs, the ability of mangroves to attenuate waves, and levee characteristics. Although all variables have equal significance in defining the mangrove forest width, the variety in levee and mangrove costs and significant wave height are the variables most likely to affect the optimal mangrove forest width. Mangroves are only useful to decrease the height of waves, thereby reducing wave run-up. This wave-attenuating effect decreases exponentially with the mangrove forest width. all Based on the literature, when considering common values for levee costs and mangrove restoration costs, levee characteristics and wave attenuation, wave attenuation is strong enough such that the optimal mangrove forest width is larger than zero. The costs of restoring mangroves depend on the required measures to enable mangroves to grow back. Hydrological restoration involves returning the mangrove area to the natural condition where mangroves are able to grow. This could, for example, be restoring a fresh water source that has been blocked by human intervention. If hydrological restoration is required and can be done cheaply, then this is the most effective option. Planting mangroves can also be a cost-effective option. Sheltering the mangrove area by using a permeable structure requires more financial resources. If large-scale filling or excavation is required, costs may increase significantly, and it is likely to be too expensive to use mangroves in flood-risk reduction. However, this cost assessment may change if the ecosystem services of mangroves are taken into account. As a rule of thumb, for mangroves to be economically effective, restoration costs [USD/m/m] in case of a 1 m wave height should remain below 0.003 times the variable levee costs [USD/m/m]. This value increases linearly with the wave height. For levee costs of 1 million USD/km/m, of which 0.6 million USD/km/m variable costs, the mangroves restoration costs should not exceed 0.18 USD/m/m, or 18,000 USD/ha. For Kaback, Guinea, the optimal mangrove forest width and height of the levee are assessed. These are 900 meter and 1.1 meter respectively, with the levee located just behind the mangroves. 900 meter is the maximum width possible, considering the physical conditions where mangroves grow. Since mangroves are growing back naturally already, costs for mangroves restoration is limited to fixed costs. The model developed in this study can be used to create a ``mangrove opportunity map”. This map can indicate—based on physical attributes—the costs, hydraulic conditions such as storm surge and wave height, and whether mangrove restoration for flood risk reduction is effective. Governments or organizations such as the World Bank can use this method to explore whether mangrove-based strategies are an option. Further research can focus on improving the cost estimates on levees and mangroves. In this study, costs are assumed to be linear with the levee height or mangrove area. In practice, levee costs might especially increase exponentially with the levee height, which would make mangroves more effective.},

We tested three approaches to determine the maximum annually recurring wave, including log-normal and extremal exceedance probability models and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) analysis using 25 yr of buoy data and long-term wave hindcasts. The annual recurring significant wave height was found to be 7.7 ±0.28 m (25 ft ±0.9 ft), and the top 10{\%} and 1{\%} wave heights during this annual swell was 9.8 ±0.35 m (32.1 ft ±1.15 ft) and 12.9 ±0.47 m (42.3 ft ±1.5 ft), respectively, for open North and Northwest Pacific swell. Directional annual wave heights were also determined by applying hindcasted swell direction to observed buoy data lacking directional information.},

For this study, ten multispectral SPOT 6/7 satellite images with a medium resolution covering the coastal waters of the study areas were analyzed. These images were geometric, radiometric, and atmospheric corrected and acquired in three different sensing dates having coverage with at least 30{\%} of lidar data. A number of 5284 random depth measurements with 0 to 50 meters depth were acquired for the ratio conversion algorithm with absolute depths and error assessment. A series of steps were performed to obtain reliable results using satellite optical data such as, sun glint process, land/sea extraction, kernel filters. The study area was divided into three sub-regions, based on the sensing date of the satellite imageries. The light attenuation in the water column increases at a depth of about thirty meters as seen in other related studies. This study identified the depth of light attenuation to determine the maximum depth that can be estimated through optical sensors. The results show that better correlation was identified up to 15 meters depth. Results of the regression analysis show the following correlation coefficients R² :0.90, 0.87, 0.80, and 0.89 with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the respective study areas to be 1.34, 1.53 1.70 and, 1.15.},

abstract = {Recent observations of summer Arctic sea ice over the satellite era show that record or near-record lows for the ice extent occurred in the years 2002-05. To determine the physical processes contributing to these changes in the Arctic pack ice, model results from a regional coupled ice-ocean model have been analyzed. Since 1988 the thickness of the simulated basinwide ice thinned by 1.31 m or 43{\%}. The thinning is greatest along the coast in the sector from the Chukchi Sea to the Beaufort Sea to Greenland. It is hypothesized that the thinning since 1988 is due to preconditioning, a trigger, and positive feedbacks: 1) the fall, winter, and spring air temperatures over the Arctic Ocean have gradually increased over the last 50 yr, leading to reduced thickness of first-year ice at the start of summer; 2) a temporary shift, starting in 1989, of two principal climate indexes (the Arctic Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation) caused a flushing of some of the older, thicker ice out of the basin and an increase in the summer open water extent; and 3) the increasing amounts of summer open water allow for increasing absorption of solar radiation, which melts the ice, warms the water, and promotes creation of thinner first-year ice, ice that often entirely melts by the end of the subsequent summer. Internal thermodynamic changes related to the positive ice-albedo feedback, not external forcing, dominate the thinning processes over the last 16 yr. This feedback continues to drive the thinning after the climate indexes return to near-normal conditions in the late 1990s. The late 1980s and early 1990s could be considered a tipping point during which the ice-ocean system began to enter a new era of thinning ice and increasing summer open water because of positive feedbacks. It remains to be seen if this era will persist or if a sustained cooling period can reverse the processes. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Meteorological Society.},

Eight constituents, M2, S2, N2, K2, 2N2, K1, O1 and Q1 have been simulated. Five secondary constituents Mu2, Nu2, L2, T2, and P1, required to insure a priori correct predictions, have been deduced by admittance. The accuracy and precision of these solutions have been estimated by reference to the harmonic constituents data set available from analysis of the entire collection of pelagic, plateau and coastal observations made to date, and archived by International Association for Physical Sciences of the Oceans and International Hydrographic Bureau. The performances of the tidal predictions made on the basis of this new set of solutions was tested by looking at the residual RMS differences at the crossover points of sea level measurements supplied by the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission, when using these predictions. -from Authors},

abstract = {This study explored the effects of coastal vegetation on tsunami damage based on field observations carried out after the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004. Study locations covered about 250 km (19 locations) on the southern coast of Sri Lanka and about 200 km (29 locations) on the Andaman coast of Thailand. The representative vegetation was classified into six types according to their habitat and the stand structures of the trees. The impact of vegetation structure on drag forces was analyzed using the observed characteristics of the tree species. The drag coefficient, including the vertical stand structures of trees, C d-all, and the vegetation thickness (cumulative trunk diameter of vegetation in the tsunami direction) per unit area, dN u (d: reference diameter of trees, N u : number of trees per unit area), varied greatly with the species classification. Based on the field survey and data analysis, Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata (hereafter R. apiculata-type), kinds of mangroves, and Pandanus odoratissimus, a representative tree that grows in beach sand, were found to be especially effective in providing protection from tsunami damage due to their complex aerial root structure. Two layers of vegetation in the vertical direction with P. odoratissimus and Casuarina equisetifolia and a horizontal vegetation structure of small and large diameter trees were also important for increasing drag and trapping floating objects, broken branches, houses, and people. The vertical structure also provided an effective soft landing for people washed up by the tsunami or for escaping when the tsunami waves hit, although its dN u is not large compared with R. apiculata-type and P. odoratissimus. In addition, the creeks inside mangroves and the gaps inside C. equisetifolia vegetation are assumed to be effective for retarding tsunami waves. This information should be considered in future coastal landscape planning, rehabilitation, and coastal resource management. {\textcopyright} International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering and Springer 2007.},

abstract = {Objectives of this study are to evaluate the performance of different satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) empirical models developed for multispectral satellite mission applications and to propose an uncertainty model based on inferential statistics. The study site is the Arcachon Bay inlet (France). A dataset composed of 450,837 echosounder data points and 89 Sentinel-2 A/B and Landsat-8 images acquired from 2013 to 2020, is generated to test and validate SDB and uncertainty models for various contrasting optical conditions. Results show that water column optical properties are characterized by a high spatio-temporal variability controlled by hydrodynamics and seasonal conditions. The best performance and highest robustness are found for the cluster-based approach using a green band log-linear regression model. A total of 80 satellite images can be exploited to calibrate SDB models, providing average values of root mean square error and maximum bathymetry of 0.53 m and 7.3 m, respectively. The uncertainty model, developed to extrapolate information beyond the calibration dataset, is based on a multi-scene approach. The sensitivity of the model to the optical variability not explained by the calibration dataset is demonstrated but represents a risk of error of less than 5{\%}. Finally, the uncertainty model applied to a diachronic analysis definitively demonstrates the interest in SDB maps for a better understanding of morphodynamic evolutions of large-scale and complex coastal systems.},

abstract = {Coastal ecosystem engineers often depend on self-facilitating feedbacks to ameliorate environmental stress. This makes the restoration of such coastal ecosystem engineers difficult. We question if we can increase transplantation success in highly dynamic coastal areas by engineering measures that promote the development of self-facilitating feedback processes. Intertidal blue mussels Mytilus edulis are a typical example of ecosystem engineers that are difficult to restore. A lack of self-facilitating feedbacks at low densities limits establishment success when young mussels are transplanted on dynamic mudflats. In a large field experiment, we investigated the possibility of increasing transplantation success by stimulating the formation of an aggregated spatial configuration in mussels, thereby reducing hydrologically induced dislodgment and the risks of predation. For this, we applied engineering measures in the form of fences that trapped wave dislodged mussels. Mussel loss rates were significantly lower when mussels were placed between both artificial fences, and in high densities (4.2 kg/m2) compared with mussels placed in areas without fences and in low densities (2.1 kg/m2). The fences induced the formation of a banded pattern with high local mussel densities, which locally reduced predation. Synthesis and applications. Our results underline the importance of actively promoting the development of self-facilitating processes, such as aggregation into patterns, in restoration projects of ecosystem engineers. In particular, the current study shows that engineering measures can help to initiate these kinds of self-facilitating interactions, especially in highly dynamic areas.},

abstract = {Bottom depth ( H ) of optically shallow waters can be retrieved from multiband imagery, where remote sensing reflectance ( R rs ) are commonly used as the input. Because of the difficulties of removing the atmospheric effects in coastal areas, quite often, there are no valid R rs from satellites for the retrieval of H . More importantly, the empirical algorithms for H are hardly portable to new measurements. In this study, using data from Landsat-8 and ICESat-2 as examples, we present an approach to retrieve H directly from the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data. It not only bypasses the requirement to correct the effects of aerosols but also shows promising portability to areas not included in algorithm development. Specifically, we use Rayleigh-corrected TOA reflectance ( $\rho$ rc ) in the 443–2300 nm range as input, along with a multilayer perceptron ( MLP H $\rho$ rc ), for the retrieval of H . More than 78,000 matchup points of $\rho$ rc and H (0–25 m) were used to train MLP H $\rho$ rc , which resulted in a Mean Absolute Percentage Difference (MARD) of 8.8{\%} and a coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of 0.96. This MLP H $\rho$ rc was further applied to Landsat-8 data of six regions not included in the training phase, generating MARD and R 2 values of 8.3{\%} and 0.98, respectively. In contrast, a conventional two-band ratio algorithm with R rs as the input generated MARD and R 2 values of 31.6{\%} and 0.68 and significantly fewer H retrievals due to failures in atmospheric correction. These results indicate a breakthrough of algorithm portability of MLP H $\rho$ rc in sensing H of optically shallow waters.},

@article{Calder2003,
abstract = {[1] Multibeam echosounders (MBES) are currently the best way to determine the bathymetry of large regions of the seabed with high accuracy. They are becoming the standard instrument for hydrographic surveying and are also used in geological studies, mineral exploration and scientific investigation of the earth's crustal deformations and life cycle. The significantly increased data density provided by an MBES has significant advantages in accurately delineating the morphology of the seabed, but comes with the attendant disadvantage of having to handle and process a much greater volume of data. Current data processing approaches typically involve (computer aided) human inspection of all data, with timeconsuming and subjective assessment of all data points. As data rates increase with each new generation of instrument and required turn-around times decrease, manual approaches become unwieldy and automatic methods of processing essential. We propose a new method for automatically processing MBES data that attempts to address concerns of efficiency, objectivity, robustness and accuracy. The method attributes each sounding with an estimate of vertical and horizontal error, and then uses a model of information propagation to transfer information about the depth from each sounding to its local neighborhood. Embedded in the survey area are estimation nodes that aim to determine the true depth at an absolutely defined location, along with its associated uncertainty. As soon as soundings are made available, the nodes independently assimilate propagated information to form depth hypotheses which are then tracked and updated on-line as more data is gathered. Consequently, we can extract at any time a "current-best" estimate for all nodes, plus co-located uncertainties and other metrics. The method can assimilate data from multiple surveys, multiple instruments or repeated passes of the same instrument in real-time as data is being gathered. The data assimilation scheme is sufficiently robust to deal with typical survey echosounder errors. Robustness is improved by pre-conditioning the data, and allowing the depth model to be incrementally defined. A model monitoring scheme ensures that inconsistent data are maintained as separate but internally consistent depth hypotheses. A disambiguation of these competing hypotheses is only carried out when required by the user. The algorithm has a low memory footprint, runs faster than data can currently be gathered, and is suitable for real-time use. We call this algorithm CUBE (Combined Uncertainty and Bathymetry Estimator). We illustrate CUBE on two data sets gathered in shallow water with different instruments and for different purposes. We show that the algorithm is robust to even gross failure modes, and reliably processes the vast majority of the data. In both cases, we confirm that the estimates made by CUBE are statistically similar to those generated by hand. Copyright 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {We analyzed current best practices and recommendations used in the implementation of mangrove rehabilitation and restoration (R/R) projects in the Atlantic-East Pacific (AEP) and the Indo-West Pacific biogeographic regions during the last 20 years. Comprehensive literature and World Wide Web searches were performed identifying 90 sites around the world where R/R actions have been implemented. For each site, we analyzed the sources of damage/impact and classified the origin as natural (siltation, erosion, the direct and indirect effect of tropical storms or tsunamis) or anthropogenic (pollution, land use policies, overharvesting, aquaculture, altered hydrology and hydroperiod). In most cases, the causes of damage were a complex mixture associated to erosion, hydrological impairment, deforestation, siltation, and land conversion for aquaculture and other land uses. The area extension of mangrove sites undergoing restoration or just afforestation ranged from few square meters to several thousand hectares. Numerous projects were implemented without an underlying science-based approach and were often ill-prepared and unsuccessful. Although there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to restore or rehabilitate mangrove wetlands, published studies (particularly peer reviewed) provide useful insights into designing R/R projects with clearly defined and prioritized management objectives based on a diagnostic of the source of damage/deterioration. A critical step is to develop a decision tree that serves as a guide to optimize the use of available funding in the development, implementation, and monitoring of R/R protocols to set clear objectives, goals and deadlines. These steps should be part of a robust research agenda based on sound ecological theory and reliable monitoring practices, including the participation of local communities. Any monitoring and reporting program should address spatial and temporal replication that explicitly includes reference sites near the target restoration site. The results of each R/R project, whether successful or not, should be published, as they are critical sources of data and information for further development of mangrove R/R practices and methods within the community of restoration ecology science. We urge the continental level implementation of guidelines to advance international initiatives aimed to protect and conserve one the most productive and threatened coastal ecosystems in the world.},

Second, careful specific site selection must take place taking into account the land use history of the site. Third, clearly stated goals and achievable and measurable success criteria need to be defined and incorporated into a proposed monitoring program, and the rehabilitation methodology must reflect an acknowledgment of the history of routine failure in attempts at mangrove rehabilitation and proposed use of proven successful techniques. Finally, after the initial rehabilitation activities are complete, the proposed monitoring program must be initiated and used to determine if the project is achieving interim measurable success to indicate whether any midcourse corrections are needed and whether future attempts at rehabilitation should be modified based on the data collected and reported.

abstract = {The dynamic coastline of Soc Trang Province in the Mekong Delta of Viet Nam is in most parts protected from erosion, storms and flooding by a narrow belt of mangroves. However, the unsustainable use of natural resources and development in the coastal zone is threatening the protection function of this forest belt. This situation is exacerbated by the impacts of climate change, particularly by the increased intensity and frequency of storms, floods and by rising sea levels. Based on analysis of past experience of mangrove planting and historical changes in mangrove cover, an integrated and site-specific approach to adaptation to climate change has been put in place, which comprises mangrove planting and rehabilitation with emphasis on resilience to climate change, and participatory involvement of local communities in effective mangrove management and protection through co-management. To address uncertainties associated with the impacts of climate change, testing of new mangrove planting techniques has started. This includes mimicking successful natural regeneration for small-scale planting in sites with high wave energy and transformation of existing even-aged plantations into more diverse forests-both in terms of structure and species composition. The pre-requisite for mangrove rehabilitation in erosion sites has successfully been put in place: breakwaters made from bamboo have reduced erosion and stimulated sedimentation. The design and construction of the wave-breaking structures, which was based on a numerical model which simulates hydrodynamics and shoreline development, ensures that downdrift erosion can be avoided as far as possible. A comprehensive monitoring program has been established and initial results provide evidence for the effectiveness of the bamboo breakwaters. Early experience shows that co-management is an effective way of maintaining and enhancing the protection function of the mangrove forest belt and at the same time providing livelihood for local communities. Payment for ecosystem services contributes to sustainability of co-management as well as livelihood improvement. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

This upcoming mission will provide data to assess changes of ice sheet elevation and mass, as well as the time-varying volume of sea ice. However, the next-generation ICESat sensor also presents new data processing challenges due to the high number of false returns present in the resultant point cloud that are mainly caused by the high sensitivity of the photon detector to solar returns. In this letter, we propose a novel noise filter for single photon laser altimeter data utilizing a Bayesian decision theory. We applied our algorithm to the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL) data sets and compared the filtered estimate of ground to coincident high resolution airborne LiDAR data. The results show that the proposed algorithm differentiates between noise and ground surface returns effectively with 6-m root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the MABEL green channel lasers and 4-m RMSE for the near-infrared channel lasers. The Bayesian approach also outperformed a commonly applied point density-based algorithm, the modified density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, particularly in areas of steep terrain.},

abstract = {Graphs depicted as node-link diagrams are widely used to show relationships between entities. However, node-link diagrams comprised of a large number of nodes and edges often suffer from visual clutter. The use of edge bundling remedies this and reveals high-level edge patterns. Previous methods require the graph to contain a hierarchy for this, or they construct a control mesh to guide the edge bundling process, which often results in bundles that show considerable variation in curvature along the overall bundle direction. We present a new edge bundling method that uses a self-organizing approach to bundling in which edges are modeled as flexible springs that can attract each other. In contrast to previous methods, no hierarchy is used and no control mesh. The resulting bundled graphs show significant clutter reduction and clearly visible high-level edge patterns. Curvature variation is furthermore minimized, resulting in smooth bundles that are easy to follow. Finally, we present a rendering technique that can be used to emphasize the bundling. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Nearshore bathymetric data are used in many coastal monitoring applications, but acquisition conditions can be challenging. Shipborne surveys are prone to the risk of grounding in shallow waters, and scheduled airborne surveys often fail to coincide with optimal atmospheric and water conditions. As an alternative, since its launch in 2018, ICESat-2 satellite laser profile altimetry data provide free and readily available data on a 91-day repeat cycle, which may contain incidental bathymetric returns when suitable environmental conditions prevail. In this paper, the vertical accuracy of extracted, refraction-adjusted ICESat-2 nearshore marine bathymetric data is evaluated at four test sites in a Northern hemisphere, temperate latitude location. Multiple ICEsat-2 bathymetric values that occurred in close horizontal proximity to one another were averaged at a spatial scale of 1 m and compared with Multibeam Echosounder bathymetric survey data and Global Navigation Satellite System reference data. Mean absolute errors of less than 0.15 m were observed up to depths of 5 m, with errors of less than 0.24 m (to 6 m), 0.39 m (to 7 m) and 0.52 m (to 10 m). The occurrence of larger bathymetric errors with depth, which increase to 0.54 m at maximum photon depths of 11 m, appears to be primarily related to reduced numbers of geolocated photons with depth. The accuracies achieved up to 6 m suggest that the manual extraction, refraction adjustment and bathymetric filtering steps were effective. Overall, the results suggest that ICESat-2 bathymetric data accuracy may be sufficient to be considered for use in nearshore coastal monitoring applications where shipborne and airborne bathymetric data might otherwise be applied.},

abstract = {Accurate bathymetric data is crucial for marine and coastal ecosystems. A lot of studies have been carried out for nearshore bathymetry using satellite data. The approach adopted extensively in shallow water depths estimation has recently been one of empirical models. However, the linear empirical model is simple and only takes limited band information at each bathymetric point into consideration. It may be not suitable for complex environments. In this paper, a deep learning framework was proposed for nearshore bathymetry (DL-NB) from ICESat-2 LiDAR and Sentinel-2 Imagery datasets. The bathymetric points from the spaceborne ICESat-2 LiDAR were extracted instead of in situ measurements. By virtue of the two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D CNN), DL-NB can make full use of the initial multi-spectral information of Sentinel-2 at each bathymetric point and its adjacent areas during the training. Based on the trained model, the bathymetric maps of several study areas were produced including the Appalachian Bay (AB), Virgin Islands (VI), and Cat Island (CI) of the United States. The performance of DL-NB was evaluated by empirical method, machine learning method and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The results indicate that the accuracy of the DL-NB is better than comparative methods can in nearshore bathymetry. After quantitative analysis, the RMSE of DL-NB could achieve 1.01 m, 1.80 m and 0.28 m in AB, VI and CI respectively. Given the same data conditions, the proposed method can be applied for high precise global scale and multitemporal nearshore bathymetric maps generation, which are beneficial to marine environmental change assessment and conservation.},

abstract = {Detailed information on lake bathymetry is essential for both hydrology-related studies and water resource management. Conventionally, lake bathymetry was mapped using high-cost approaches (e.g., ship/boat-based multibeam echosounders or airborne bathymetric lidars). With only satellite remotely sensed data sets, a method for deriving high-resolution bathymetry for dynamic areas was proposed by combining the new Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) lidar data and the Landsat-based Global Surface Water Data Set (GSWD). First, ICESat-2 can provide accurate along-track topographic points after the point cloud processing and bathymetric error correction, and the GSWD can supply water occurrence information within the lake dynamic area between 1984 and 2018. Second, using the derived relationship between the elevation and water occurrence, the bathymetric map of Lake Mead, USA, was produced with the dynamic area exceeding 235 km2, elevation ranging nearly 37 m, and a resolution of 30 m. The local reference data (i.e., the airborne topographic lidar data and ship/boat-based bathymetric data) in six areas around Lake Mead were used for the validations. In general, the produced lake bathymetry achieved an accuracy of approximately 2 m in elevation with {\$}R{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} of 0.97. The proposed method is promising to obtain global bathymetry for inland water bodies (e.g., the lake and reservoir) and coastal areas (e.g., the tidal zone) where water level fluctuations are strong and the water clarity is sufficient.},

The resulting element of discretization for the coupled model is analysed and two different coupling techniques based on mass conservation and mass and momentum conservation respectively are explored, considering both frontal and lateral configurations. The interaction with the boundaries in each model is highlighted and the necessity of using the appropriate strategy according to the flow regime is also justified. The coupled model is tested through academic test cases where the numerical results are compared with a fully 2D model as well as with experimental measurements in steady and unsteady scenarios. It is also applied to a real world configuration, where the flood wave propagation in the river bed is simulated by means of a 1D model and the inundation of the riverside is dealt with a 2D model.

abstract = {Concepts of risk and uncertainty are commonly used for designing and evaluating flood-related hydraulic structures. A general framework for estimating the uncertainty of the return period and risk is presented based on first-order analysis of uncertainty for determining the variance of the return period and risk of failure and the methods of moments, probability weighted moments, and maximum likelihood. The general method is illustrated using the exponential and Gumbel distributions. The derived variance of the return period is a function of the sample size N and the nonexceedance probability q, while that of the risk is function of N, q, and design life n. Simulation experiments were performed to analyze the behavior of the variance of risk for various values of N, q, and n. They showed that the derived variances of the risk can be applicable for a wide range of conditions, particularly for sample sizes bigger than 50 and design lives smaller or equal to 50. An example is included to illustrate the applicability of the proposed concepts and equations. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584 .0000613. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {Climate change is increasing the threat of erosion and flooding along coastlines globally. Engineering solutions (e.g. seawalls and breakwaters) in response to protecting coastal communities and associated infrastructure are increasingly becoming economically and ecologically unsustainable. This has led to recommendations to create or restore natural habitats, such as sand dunes, saltmarsh, mangroves, seagrass and kelp beds, and coral and shellfish reefs, to provide coastal protection in place of (or to complement) artificial structures. Coastal managers are frequently faced with the problem of an eroding coastline, which requires a decision on what mitigation options are most appropriate to implement. A barrier to uptake of nature-based coastal defence is stringent evaluation of the effectiveness in comparison to artificial protection structures. Here, we assess the current evidence for the efficacy of nature-based vs. artificial coastal protection and discuss future research needs. Future projects should evaluate habitats created or restored for coastal defence for cost-effectiveness in comparison to an artificial structure under the same environmental conditions. Cost-benefit analyses should take into consideration all ecosystem services provided by nature-based or artificial structures in addition to coastal protection. Interdisciplinary research among scientists, coastal managers and engineers is required to facilitate the experimental trials needed to test the value of these shoreline protection schemes, in order to support their use as alternatives to artificial structures. This research needs to happen now as our rapidly changing climate requires new and innovative solutions to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities to an increasingly uncertain future.},

However, these newly erupted volcanic islands become observable to airborne and/or satellite remote sensing instruments. NASA's ICESat-2 satellite laser altimeter, combined with visible imagery (optical and microwave), provide a novel method of evaluating the elevation characteristics of newly emerged volcanoes and their subaerial eruption products. Niijima Fukutoku-Okanoba (NFO) is a submarine volcano 1300 km south of Tokyo (Ogasawara Archipelago of Japan) that periodically breaches the ocean surface to create new islands that are subsequently eroded. The recent eruption in August 2021 is a rare opportunity to investigate this island evolution using high-resolution satellite datasets with geodetic-quality ICESat-2 altimetry. Lansdat-8 and Planet imagery provide a qualitative analysis of the exposed volcanic deposits, while ICESat-2 products provide elevation profiles necessary to quantify the physical surface structures. This investigation determines an innovative application for ICESat-2 data in evaluating newly emerged islands and how the combination of satellite remote sensing (visible and lidar) to investigate these short-lived volcanic features can improve our understanding of the volcanic island system in ways not previously possible.},

abstract = {Physical processes limiting colonization of bare tidal flats by pioneer mangrove species have commonly been described but not yet quantified. Understanding thresholds to early seedling establishment is critical for successful restoration and management of mangrove forests. We determined how seedling establishment of Avicennia alba Bl. is affected by the combination of increasing hydrodynamic forces and sediment dynamics. As the buoyant propagules of A. alba are dispersed by water, early establishment on bare tidal flats requires propagules to quickly anchor to stay in place. Flume studies and field observations showed that 3 thresholds have to be passed until the seedling is successfully established: (1) stranded propagules need an inundation- free period to rapidly develop roots that are long enough to withstand displacement by flooding, (2) roots need to become long enough to withstand seedling dislodgement by hydrodynamic forces from waves and currents, with the required root length being proportional to the force that needs to be resisted, (3) even longer roots are needed to survive high energy events that cause sheet erosion and can thereby induce seedling dislodgement. This sequence of thresholds implies that establishment of the pioneer mangrove species A. alba requires a suitable window of opportunity to pass all thresholds and underlines the importance of rapid root expansion as a crucial pioneer trait for the species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Inter-Research.},

To date, approximately 120 000 ha of mangroves have been planted. Nursery and planting techniques have been developed for the major species, while additional species are still being investigated. As a result of the extensive monospecific plantations, however, outbreaks of two major insect pest species have been observed.

abstract = {Recent and highly accurate topographic data should be used for flood inundation modeling, but this is not always feasible given time and budget constraints so the utility of several on-line digital elevation models (DEMs) is examined with a set of steady and unsteady test problems. DEMs are used to parameterize a 2D hydrodynamic flood simulation algorithm and predictions are compared with published flood maps and observed flood conditions. DEMs based on airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) are preferred because of horizontal resolution, vertical accuracy (∼0.1 m) and the ability to separate bare-earth from built structures and vegetation. DEMs based on airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IfSAR) have good horizontal resolution but gridded elevations reflect built structures and vegetation and therefore further processing may be required to permit flood modeling. IfSAR and shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) DEMs suffer from radar speckle, or noise, so flood plains may appear with non-physical relief and predicted flood zones may include non-physical pools. DEMs based on national elevation data (NED) are remarkably smooth in comparison to IfSAR and SRTM but using NED, flood predictions overestimate flood extent in comparison to all other DEMs including LiDAR, the most accurate. This study highlights utility in SRTM as a global source of terrain data for flood modeling. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Technological aspects of producing, delivering and updating of flood hazard maps in the US have has gone through a revolutionary change through Federal Emergency Management Agency's Map Modernization program. In addition, the use of topographic information derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is enabling creation of relatively more accurate flood inundation maps. However, LIDAR is not available for the entire United States. Even for areas, where LIDAR data are available, the effect of other factors such as cross-section configuration in one-dimensional (1D) models, mesh resolution in two-dimensional models (2D), representation of river bathymetry, and modeling approach is not well studied or documented. The objective of this paper is to address some of these issues by comparing newly developed flood inundation maps from LIDAR data to maps that are developed using different topography, geometric description and modeling approach. The methodology involves use of six topographic datasets with different horizontal resolutions, vertical accuracies and bathymetry details. Each topographic dataset is used to create a flood inundation map for twelve different cross-section configurations using 1D HEC-RAS model, and two mesh resolutions using 2D FESWMS model. Comparison of resulting maps for two study areas (Strouds Creek in North Carolina and Brazos River in Texas) show that the flood inundation area reduces with improved horizontal resolution and vertical accuracy in the topographic data. This reduction is further enhanced by incorporating river bathymetry in topography data. Overall, the inundation extent predicted by FESWMS is smaller compared to prediction from HEC-RAS for the study areas, and that the variations in the flood inundation maps arising from different factors are smaller in FESWMS compared to HEC-RAS. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Spaceborne digital elevation models (DEMs) are a fundamental input for many geoscience studies, but they still include nonnegligible height errors. Here we introduce a high-accuracy global DEM at 3″ resolution ({\~{}}90 m at the equator) by eliminating major error components from existing DEMs. We separated absolute bias, stripe noise, speckle noise, and tree height bias using multiple satellite data sets and filtering techniques. After the error removal, land areas mapped with ±2 m or better vertical accuracy were increased from 39{\%} to 58{\%}. Significant improvements were found in flat regions where height errors larger than topography variability, and landscapes such as river networks and hill-valley structures, became clearly represented. We found the topography slope of previous DEMs was largely distorted in most of world major floodplains (e.g., Ganges, Nile, Niger, and Mekong) and swamp forests (e.g., Amazon, Congo, and Vasyugan). The newly developed DEM will enhance many geoscience applications which are terrain dependent.},

abstract = {Dam-break flood waves are associated with major environmental disasters provoked by the sudden release of water stored in reservoirs. Ritter found in 1892 an analytical solution to the wave structure of an ideal fluid released during an instantaneous dam failure, propagating over initially dry horizontal terrain. This solution, though ideal, hence frictionless, is widely used to test numerical solutions of the Shallow Water Equations (SWE), and as educational tool in courses of fluid mechanics, given that it is a peculiar case of the Riemann problem. However, the real wave structure observed experimentally differs in a major portion of the wave profile, including the positive and negative fronts. Given the importance of an accurate prediction of the dam break wave, the positive and negative wave portions originating from the breaking of a dam with initially dry land on the tailwater reach are revisited in this work. First, the propagation features of the dry-front are investigated using an analytical boundary-layer type model (Whitham/Dressler/Chanson model) constructed matching an (outer) inviscid dynamic wave to an (inner) viscous diffusive wave. The analytical solution is evaluated using an accurate numerical solution of the SWE produced using the MUSCL-Hancock finite-volume method, which is tested independently obtaining the solution based on the discontinuous Galerkin finite-element method. The propagation features of the negative wave are poorly reproduced by the SWE during the initial stages of dam break flows, and, thus, are then investigated using the Serre–Green–Naghdi equations for weakly-dispersive fully non-linear water waves, which are solved using a finite volume-finite difference scheme.},

Aimed at the abovementioned issues, a new geospatial data model, X3DORGDM(X3D-based Oriented-Relation Geospatial Data Model) is designed according to the integration among the improvement of database theory, the development of computational geometry algorithms and the deployment of next generation data format of Web visualization, X3D(eXensible 3D). Through a quantitative analysis on X3DORGDM, the result shows the determinants of its spatial computing and the performance of its topological computation.

abstract = {Bathymetry has been traditionally charted via shipboard echo sounding. Alhough able to generate accurate depth measurements at points or along transects, this method is constrained by its high operating cost, inefﬁciency, and inapplicability to shallow waters. By comparison, remote sensing methods offer more ﬂexible, efﬁcient and cost-effective means of mapping bathymetry over broad areas. Remote sensing of bathymetry falls into two broad categories: non-imaging and imaging methods. The non-imaging method (as typiﬁed by LiDAR) is able to produce accurate bathymetric information over clear waters at a depth up to 70 m. However, this method is limited by the coarse bathymetric sampling interval and high cost. The imaging method can be implemented either analytically or empirically, or by a combination of both. Analytical or semianalytical implementation is based on the manner of light transmission in water. It requires inputs of a number of parameters related to the properties of the atmosphere, water column, and bottom material. Thus, it is rather complex and difﬁcult to use. By comparison, empirical implementation is much simpler and requires the input of fewer parameters. Both implementations can produce ﬁne-detailed bathymetric maps over extensive turbid coastal and inland lake waters quickly, even though concurrent depth samples are essential. The detectable depth is usually limited to 20 m. The accuracy of the retrieved bathymetry varies with water depth, with the accuracy substantially lower at a depth beyond 12 m. Other inﬂuential factors include water turbidity and bottom materials, as well as image properties.},

Laboratory data of wave heights on shallow foreshores of different slopes have been analysed to determine these effects and to derive generalised empirical parameterisations. A model distribution is proposed consisting of a Rayleigh distribution, or a Weibull distribution with exponent equal to 2, for the lower heights and a Weibull with a higher exponent for the higher wave heights. The parameters of this distribution have been estimated from the data and expressed in terms of local wave energy, depth and bottom slope, yielding a predictive model that is found to be significantly more accurate than existing expressions.},

The integration of these data, via data assimilation, can result in a more holistic characterization of these highly dynamic ecosystems, and consequently improve water resource management. It is becoming common to see combinations of these data applied to answer relevant scientific questions. Yet, methods for scaling water quality data across regions and beyond, to provide actionable knowledge for stakeholders, have emerged only recently, particularly with the availability of satellite data now providing global coverage at high spatial resolution. In this paper, data sources and existing data integration frameworks are reviewed to give an overview of the present status and identify the gaps in existing frameworks. We propose an integration framework to provide information to user communities through the the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) AquaWatch Initiative.

abstract = {Mangroves are found globally throughout tropical and sub-tropical inter-tidal coastlines. These highly biodiverse and carbon-dense ecosystems have multi-faceted value, providing critical goods and services to millions living in coastal communities and making significant contributions to global climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration and storage. Despite their many values, mangrove loss continues to be widespread in many regions due primarily to anthropogenic activities. Accessible, intuitive tools that enable coastal managers to map and monitor mangrove cover are needed to stem this loss. Remotely sensed data have a proven record for successfully mapping and monitoring mangroves, but conventional methods are limited by imagery availability, computing resources and accessibility. In addition, the variable tidal levels in mangroves presents a unique mapping challenge, particularly over geographically large extents. Here we present a new tool—the Google Earth Engine Mangrove Mapping Methodology (GEEMMM)—an intuitive, accessible and replicable approach which caters to a wide audience of non-specialist coastal managers and decision makers. The GEEMMM was developed based on a thorough review and incorporation of relevant mangrove remote sensing literature and harnesses the power of cloud computing including a simplified image-based tidal calibration approach. We demonstrate the tool for all of coastal Myanmar (Burma)—a global mangrove loss hotspot—including an assessment of multi-date mapping and dynamics outputs and a comparison of GEEMMM results to existing studies. Results—including both quantitative and qualitative accuracy assessments and comparisons to existing studies—indicate that the GEEMMM provides an accessible approach to map and monitor mangrove ecosystems anywhere within their global distribution.},

abstract = {Bathymetry is a knowledge of water depth calculation, which is of great importance in many environmental management applications. The objective of this study is to improve the accuracy of the traditional ratio model as a widely used experimental bathymetry method. Therefore, firstly hybrid methods were proposed, which combined principal component analysis (PCA) and image fusion methods, to obtain more informative inputs for the Nayband bay bathymetry mapping under conditions of high turbidity. The results showed that the proposed hybrid bathymetry methods highly improved the accuracy of the depth maps. Then, two new algorithms, namely HybF{\_}PSO and HybF{\_}GA, have been introduced based on combining the proposed hybrid methods and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) or the genetic algorithm (GA) optimization methods. PSO and GA optimization methods were utilized to calculate the constant parameters of the depth model optimally. Compared to the traditional ratio model, the HybF{\_}GA algorithm improved the bathymetry accuracy of depths shallower than − 2 m from 2.93 to 2.53, depths between − 2 and − 4 m from 3.2 to 1.56, depths between − 4 and − 8 m from 2.4 to 1.88, and areas deeper that − 8 m from 5.24 to 2.93. The HybF{\_}PSO algorithm improved the accuracy of mapping areas deeper than − 8 m even more than the HybF{\_}GA algorithm. Compared to the traditional ratio model, the HybF{\_}PSO algorithm also highly improved the bathymetry accuracy in all the depth classes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed bathymetry algorithms are very applicable and helpful.},

abstract = {Rivers self-organize their pattern/planform through feedbacks between bars, channels, floodplain and vegetation, which emerge as a result of the basic spatial sorting process of wash load sediment and bed sediment. The balance between floodplain formation and destruction determines the width and pattern of channels. Floodplain structure affects the style and rate of channel avulsion once aggradation takes place. Downstream fining of bed sediment and the sediment balance of fines in the pores of the bed sediment provide the ‘template' or sediment boundary conditions, from which sorting at smaller scales leads to the formation of distinct channel patterns. Bar patterns provide the template of bank erosion and formation as well as the dynamics of the channel network through bifurcation destabilization. However, so far we have been unable to obtain dynamic meandering in laboratory experiments and in physics-based models that can also produce braiding, which reflects our lack of understanding of what causes the different river patterns.},

abstract = {The extreme value index is a fundamental parameter in univariate Extreme Value Theory (EVT). It captures the tail behavior of a distribution and is central in the extrapolation beyond observations. Among other semi-parametric methods (such as the popular Hill estimator), the Block Maxima (BM) and Peaks-Over-Threshold (POT) methods are widely used for assessing the extreme value index and related normalizing constants. We provide asymptotic theory for the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) based on the BM method for independent and identically distributed observations in the max-domain of attraction of some extreme value distribution. Our main result is the asymptotic normality of the MLE with a non-trivial bias depending on the extreme value index and on the so-called second-order parameter. Our approach combines asymptotic expansions of the likelihood process and of the empirical quantile process of block maxima. The results permit to complete the comparison of common semi-parametric estimators in EVT (MLE and probability weighted moment estimators based on the POT or BM methods) through their asymptotic variances, biases and optimal mean square errors.},

abstract = {Seascape ecology is an emerging pattern-oriented and integrative science conceptually linked to landscape ecology. It aims to quantify multidimensional spatial structure in the sea and reveal its ecological consequences. The seascape ecology approach has made important advances in shallow coastal environments, and increasing exploration and mapping of the deep seabed provides opportunities for application in the deep ocean. We argue that seascape ecology, with its integrative and multiscale perspective, can generate new scientific insights at spatial and temporal scales relevant to ecosystem-based management. Seascape ecology provides a conceptual and operational framework that integrates and builds on existing benthic ecology and habitat mapping research by providing additional pattern-oriented concepts, tools and techniques to (1) quantify complex ecological patterns across multiple scales; (2) link spatial patterns to biodiversity and ecological processes; and (3) provide ecologically meaningful information that is operationally relevant to spatial management. This review introduces seascape ecology and provides a framework for its application to deep-seabed environments. Research areas are highlighted where seascape ecology can advance the ecological understanding of deep benthic environments.},

abstract = {Bike-sharing is becoming increasingly popular as an urban traffic mode while
increasing the affordability, flexibility, and reliability of interconnected
public transportation systems (i.e., interconnected light rail, buses,
micro-mobility, and ride-sharing modes of transportation). From the consumers
perspective, 1) finding a bike station in convenient locations where demand
usually occurs and 2) the availability of bikes at rush hours with a lesser
probability of encountering empty docks (for fixed-station bike-share systems)
are two key concerns. Some stations are more likely to be empty or full,
reflecting an imbalance in bike supply and demand. Accordingly, it is essential
to understand a bike-share system's demand pattern to select the optimal
locations and reallocate bikes to the right stations to increase the
utilization rate and reduce the number of unserved customers (i.e., potential
demand). The Capital Bikeshare in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area is one of
the prominent bike-share systems in the USA - with more than 4,300 bikes
available at 654 stations across seven jurisdictions. This study provides a
systematic analysis of a bike-sharing system's Capital Bikeshare system usage
pattern. Our study intends to create an optimization strategy formulated as a
deterministic integer programming for reallocating bike stations daily and
rebalancing the bike supply system. From an operational perspective, such a
strategy will allow overnight preparations to answer the rush-hour morning
demand and during special events in Washington D.C.},

abstract = {This study presents a new global baseline of mangrove extent for 2010 and has been released as the first output of the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) initiative. This is the first study to apply a globally consistent and automated method for mapping mangroves, identifying a global extent of 137,600 km     2    . The overall accuracy for mangrove extent was 94.0{\%} with a 99{\%} likelihood that the true value is between 93.6–94.5{\%}, using 53,878 accuracy points across 20 sites distributed globally. Using the geographic regions of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Asia has the highest proportion of mangroves with 38.7{\%} of the global total, while Latin America and the Caribbean have 20.3{\%}, Africa has 20.0{\%}, Oceania has 11.9{\%}, North America has 8.4{\%} and the European Overseas Territories have 0.7{\%}. The methodology developed is primarily based on the classification of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor data, where a habitat mask was first generated, within which the classification of mangrove was undertaken using the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier. This new globally consistent baseline will also form the basis of a mangrove monitoring system using JAXA JERS-1 SAR, ALOS PALSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 radar data to assess mangrove change from 1996 to the present. However, when using the product, users should note that a minimum mapping unit of 1 ha is recommended and that the error increases in regions of disturbance and where narrow strips or smaller fragmented areas of mangroves are present. Artefacts due to cloud cover and the Landsat-7 SLC-off error are also present in some areas, particularly regions of West Africa due to the lack of Landsat-5 data and persistence cloud cover. In the future, consideration will be given to the production of a new global baseline based on 10 m Sentinel-2 composites.},

abstract = {The most prevalent global surface models are derived from space-based technologies. The spatial and temporal coverage of radar and imaging systems have significant advantage over other sensors and platforms. However, these systems are often are challenged in certain environmental conditions to produce accurate elevations as compared to what might achieved with laser altimetry. Radar derived DEM (Digital Elevation Model) elevation accuracy is often less in vegetated regions, as the wavelengths associated with radar mapping missions do not fully penetrate the canopy. Elevation errors are also substantial over dynamic topography. Correction models using airborne lidar reference datasets can be effective for localized studies to improve the DEM but often the data is not readily available or seasonally/temporally irrelevant. This work presents an automated method for correcting digital terrain models derived from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) elevation products using NASA's newest Earth observing laser altimeter, the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). ICESat-2 elevations, in concert with Landsat 8 (global imagery), create a model based correction strategy for the SRTM derived elevations using geographically correlated canopy cover and surface slope information. The results are validated at the study site using high-resolution, high fidelity airborne lidar datasets as a reference surface. The application of the correction model on the radar measurements results in nearly 50{\%} improvement in elevation accuracy for this region. Additionally this established proof of concept provides a starting point for further research in how this method, with ICESat-2 data, can be extended to other environmental regions, other radar or image derived elevation products and inform future techniques for similar application at the global scale.},

abstract = {High spatial resolution bathymetric maps of coral reefs can show the details of terrain. However, most satellite-based imagery with a spatial resolution {\textless} 10 m has only three visible bands and one near-infrared (NIR) band. When in situ bathymetric data are unavailable, it is difficult to map bathymetry from high spatial resolution imagery with spectral matching or empirical models for clear or turbid waters. In this study, we developed a downscaled bathymetric mapping approach (DBMA) that uses the water depth estimated from multitemporal Landsat-8 data to calibrate the empirical model for high spatial resolution imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2A/B, GaoFen-1/2, ZiYuan-3, and WorldView-2) in the absence of in situ bathymetric data. Our results show that DBMA provides high accuracy for depth ranging from 0 to 12 m for clear waters (0 m to 5 m for turbid waters), with a root mean squared error (RMSE) smaller than 2 m. Relative to empirical models (calibrated with in situ data), DBMA underestimates water depth more for depth {\textgreater}12 m for clear waters (5 m for turbid waters) while slightly overestimates more for depth {\textless} 4 m for clear waters (3 m for turbid waters). Nevertheless, DBMA performs better than the empirical models for depth between 4 m and 12 m for clear waters (3 m and 5 m for turbid waters). Furthermore, the good performance of DBMA is also demonstrated by the finding that the scaling effect on the DBMA is limited. DBMA presents a reliable solution to obtain high spatial resolution bathymetric maps without leaving out small regions in the absence of in situ data.},

abstract = {This research investigated the performance of four different machine learning supervised image classifiers: artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) using SPOT-7 and Sentinel-1 images to classify mangrove age and species in 2019 in a Red River estuary, typical of others found in northern Viet Nam. The four classifiers were chosen because they are considered to have high accuracy, however, their use in mangrove age and species classifications has thus far been limited. A time-series of Landsat images from 1975 to 2019 was used to map mangrove extent changes using the unsupervised classification method of iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (ISODATA) and a comparison with accuracy of K-means classification, which found that mangrove extent has increased, despite a fall in the 1980s, indicating the success of mangrove plantation and forest protection efforts by local people in the study area. To evaluate the supervised image classifiers, 183 in situ training plots were assessed, 70{\%} of them were used to train the supervised algorithms, with 30{\%} of them employed to validate the results. In order to improve mangrove species separations, Gram–Schmidt and principal component analysis image fusion techniques were applied to generate better quality images. All supervised and unsupervised (2019) results of mangrove age, species, and extent were mapped and accuracy was evaluated. Confusion matrices were calculated showing that the classified layers agreed with the ground-truth data where most producer and user accuracies were greater than 80{\%}. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients (around 0.9) indicated that the image classifications were very good. The test showed that SVM was the most accurate, followed by DT, ANN, and RF in this case study. The changes in mangrove extent identified in this study and the methods tested for using remotely sensed data will be valuable to monitoring and evaluation assessments of mangrove plantation projects.},

abstract = {With the development of photon-counting sensors, spaceborne photon-counting lidars have shown many advantages in mapping underwater topography. Although a space based lidar is normally a profiling system, the depth penetration and the vertical accuracy achieved with a bathymetric lidar is superior to imagery (that only provides relative depths). Therefore, many satellite derived bathymetry products use both active/passive spaceborne data to achieve spatial coverage as well as absolute depth measurements. Compared with shipborne and airborne bathymetric systems, satellite derived bathymetry data can have a global coverage, especially covering some remote areas where airborne/shipborne systems are hard or very expensive to reach. In this paper, a theoretical model is proposed to quantitatively analyze the maximum bathymetric depth of a satellite photon-counting lidar, which considers the system parameters, environmental effects, and the constraint of the SNR (signal to noise ratio). System parameters of ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) as well as the MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) datasets are used to provide systematic and environmental inputs to the model, and the ICESat-2 actual bathymetric data are used to verify the maximum depth estimated by the proposed model. In six different sites with different water qualities, solar angles and wind speeds, the theoretical maximum bathymetric depths agree well with the actually achieved ICESat-2 lidar depths, in terms of MAE (mean absolute error) of 0.50 m and the RMSE (root mean square error) of 0.60 m. The errors in all study areas are within 14{\%} of the corresponding maximum depths. Additionally, the non-linear response of a photon-counting lidar, independent parameter impacts on the theoretical model, and the errors in the experimental process were quantitatively analyzed. In the future, this theoretical model can be used to evaluate the maximum bathymetric depth for a bathymetry investigation when applying system parameters and environmental parameters. In addition, it can be used to optimize the hardware parameters of a photon-counting lidar in its early design process.},

abstract = {Erosion and progradation are natural dynamics that take place across mangrove landscapes, but anthropogenic pressure may disturb these dynamics and cause increased erosion. The increased erosion of mangrove coastlines leads to mangrove degradation and loss of ecosystem services. However, to map the extent of erosion and progradation in dynamic landscapes is often time and data consuming and challenging to perform at a large scale. This study uses cloud computing-based remote sensing analysis in Google Earth Engine to map the extent of mangrove shoreline dynamics in two contrasting hotspots: the Sundarbans mangrove complex across India and Bangladesh, and the coast of French Guiana. Mapping was performed between 1984 and 2018 using available data on mangrove distribution and surface water change, classifying change of states as permanent, seasonal and ephemeral. Between 1984 and 2018, erosion and progradation accounted for 24.55{\%} and 12.52{\%} of total change, respectively. Contrastingly, in French Guiana erosion and progradation accounted for 9.53{\%} and 4.48{\%} of total change, respectively. The Sundarbans experienced more permanent changes as compared to French Guiana. The permanent loss of mangrove forests in the Sundarbans can be attributed to the reduction in sediment supply and the temporary loss in French Guiana to cyclical patterns of migrating mudbanks. The methods presented in this study performed with an overall accuracy above 90{\%} in different settings of both the case studies. This study provides an important baseline of mangrove erosion and progradation extent and an improved method to analyse coastal dynamics in mangrove landscapes.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal datasets are rapidly growing in size. For example, environmental variables are measured with increasing resolution by increasing numbers of automated sensors mounted on satellites and aircraft. Using such data, which are typically noisy and incomplete, the goal is to obtain complete maps of the spatio-temporal process, together with uncertainty quantification. We focus here on real-time filtering inference in linear Gaussian state-space models. At each time point, the state is a spatial field evaluated on a very large spatial grid, making exact inference using the Kalman filter computationally infeasible. Instead, we propose a multi-resolution filter (MRF), a highly scalable and fully probabilistic filtering method that resolves spatial features at all scales. We prove that the MRF matrices exhibit a particular block-sparse multi-resolution structure that is preserved under filtering operations through time. We describe connections to existing methods, including hierarchical matrices from numerical mathematics. We also discuss inference on time-varying parameters using an approximate Rao-Blackwellized particle filter, in which the integrated likelihood is computed using the MRF. Using a simulation study and a real satellite-data application, we show that the MRF strongly outperforms competing approaches. Supplementary materials include Python code for reproducing the simulations, some detailed properties of the MRF and auxiliary theoretical results.},

In addition, formulas were developed to predict wave transmission over low-crested rubble mound structures, taking into account the crest height and width, wave height and wave steepness.

abstract = {In 2018, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is scheduled to launch the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), with a new six-beam, green-wavelength, photon-counting lidar system, Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS). The primary objectives of the ICESat-2 mission are to measure ice-sheet elevations, sea-ice thickness, and global biomass. However, if bathymetry can be reliably retrieved from ATLAS data, this could assist in addressing a key data need in many coastal and inland water body areas, including areas that are poorly-mapped and/or difficult to access. Additionally, ATLAS-derived bathymetry could be used to constrain bathymetry derived from complementary data, such as passive, multispectral imagery and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). As an important first step in evaluating the ability to map bathymetry from ATLAS, this study involves a detailed assessment of bathymetry from the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL), NASA's airborne ICESat-2 simulator, flown on the Earth Resources 2 (ER-2) high-altitude aircraft. An interactive, web interface, MABEL Viewer, was developed and used to identify bottom returns in Keweenaw Bay, Lake Superior. After applying corrections for refraction and channel-specific elevation biases, MABEL bathymetry was compared against National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data acquired two years earlier. The results indicate that MABEL reliably detected bathymetry in depths of up to 8 m, with a root mean square (RMS) difference of 0.7 m, with respect to the reference data. Additionally, a version of the lidar equation was developed for predicting bottom-return signal levels in MABEL and tested using the Keweenaw Bay data. Future work will entail extending these results to ATLAS, as the technical specifications of the sensor become available.},

Geospatial networks are graphs where nodes and links can be associated with geographic locations. Examples can include social networks, trade and migration, as well as traffic and transport networks. Visualizing geospatial networks poses numerous challenges around the integration of both network and geographical information as well as additional information such as node and link attributes, time and uncertainty. Our overview analyses existing techniques along four dimensions: (i) the representation of geographical information, (ii) the representation of network information, (iii) the visual integration of both and (iv) the use of interaction.

abstract = {The Niger Delta Region is the largest river delta in Africa and features the fifth largest mangrove forest on Earth. It provides numerous ecosystem services to the local populations and holds a wealth of biodiversity. However, due to the oil and gas reserves and the explosion of human population it is under threat from overexploitation and degradation. There is a pressing need for an accurate assessment of the land cover dynamics in the region. The limited previous efforts have produced controversial results, as the area of western Africa is notorious for the gaps in the Landsat archive and the lack of cloud-free data. Even fewer studies have attempted to map the extent of the degraded mangrove forest system, reporting low accuracies. Here, we map the eight main land cover classes over the NDR using spectral-temporal metrics from all available Landsat data centred around three epochs. We also test the performance of the classification when L-band radar data are added to the Landsat-based metrics. To further our understanding of the land cover change dynamics, we carry out two additional assessments: a change intensity analysis for the entire NDR and, focusing specifically on the mangrove forest, we analyse the fragmentation of both the healthy and the degraded mangrove land cover classes. We achieve high overall classification accuracies in all epochs ( 79{\%} for 1988, and 82{\%} for 2000 and 2013) and are able to map the degraded mangroves accurately, for the first time, with user's accuracies between 77{\%} and 87{\%} and producer's accuracies consistently above 82{\%}. Our results show that mangrove forests, lowland rainforests, and freshwater forests are reporting net and highly intense losses (mangrove net loss:  500 km2; woodland net loss:  1400 km2), while built-up areas have almost doubled in size (from 1990 km2 in 1988 to 3730 km2 in 2013). The mangrove forests are also consistently more fragmented, with the opposite effect being observed for the degraded mangroves in more recent years. Our study provides a valuable assessment of land cover dynamics in the NDR and the first ever accurate estimates of the extent of the degraded mangrove forest and its fragmentation.},

abstract = {Simulations of nearshore waves using the Steady-State Spectral Wave (STWAVE) Model with temporally-varying bathymetric boundary conditions were undertaken for a period of 11 months at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility in Duck, NC. Five sets of bathymetry were tested, two of which were derived from survey data (one evolving with each monthly bathymetric survey, one static) and three were derived from the depth inversion algorithm, cBathy, using Argus optical imagery data updated every half hour. The standard cBathy half-hourly Kalman filtered product was used along with two modified versions that filter depth estimates during large waves prior to being assimilated by the Kalman filter using an offshore wave height threshold or an optically derived wave breaking threshold to reduce bottom boundary condition errors. Bathymetry derived from the modified Kalman filter methods were first validated using continuous in-situ sonic altimeter data, and were found to improve RMSEs relative to the original cBathy bathymetry from an average of about 0.09 m and about 0.15 m offshore and onshore of the sandbar, respectively. Wave model results over the five bathymetric boundary conditions show that the thresholded cBathy bathymetry performs similarly (and slightly better in places) to simulations using an evolving bathymetry as new measurements are available. The wave height predictions using the static bathymetry were approximately equivalent in performance (if not, slightly better in places) to that of the original cBathy, while the evolving surveyed bathymetry had similar performance to the thresholded cBathy method.},

abstract = {Little is known about the effectiveness of mangroves in suppressing water level heights during landfall of tropical storms and hurricanes. Recent hurricane strikes along the Gulf Coast of the United States have impacted wetland integrity in some areas and hastened the need to understand how and to what degree coastal forested wetlands confer protection by reducing the height of peak water level. In recent years, U.S. Geological Survey Gulf Coast research projects in Florida have instrumented mangrove sites with continuous water level recorders. Our ad hoc network of water level recorders documented the rise, peak, and fall of water levels (± 0.5 hr) from two hurricane events in 2004 and 2005. Reduction of peak water level heights from relatively in-line gages associated with one storm surge event indicated that mangrove wetlands can reduce water level height by as much as 9.4 cm/km inland over intact, relatively unchannelized expanses. During the other event, reductions were slightly less for mangroves along a river corridor. Estimates of water level attenuation were within the range reported in the literature but erred on the conservative side. These synoptic data from single storm events indicate that intact mangroves may support a protective role in reducing maximum water level height associated with surge.},

abstract = {Currently there is limited information to estimate accurate and reliable mangrove forest area in Cambodia. Previous estimates did not explicitly illustrate the spatial distribution of mangrove for the entire country however, according to Global Forest Resource Assessment 2010, Cambodia's mangrove area cover in 1990 and 2010 was calculated at 79,638 ha and 55,704 ha, respectively using extrapolation of 1992-1996 (original data from Remote Sensing of forest cover 1992/93 and 1996/97) for 1990 and extrapolation of 1996-2002 (original data from Remote Sensing of forest cover 1996/97 and 2002) for 2010. This study mapped the spatial distribution of Cambodia's mangrove forest derived from 30 m × 30 m spatial resolution and polygon spatial extent from Landsat 8 (L8) image. Publicly available Landsat data was acquired from Google Earth Engine (GEE) Explorer including the Landsat Surface Reflectance-Landsat 8 (L8) OLI/TIRS; Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) L8 32-Day Reflectance Composite; Landsat Archive Pre-Collection from US Geological Survey (USGS, 2015); VHR Google-derived images (Collin et al. 2014) and field data collection from 63 plots representing the entire Cambodia of Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program (SWAMP) to create a Google Fusion Table aiming at mapping the spatial resolution and extent. Random Forest (RF) Classifier, a supervised classification technique, was applied to three L8 images Archive Pre-Collection Level-1 (L8 OLI/TIRS) collected in December 2014, February 2015 and April 2015. Statistical analysis indicates the total area of mangrove forest cover reached 73,240ha with overall classification accuracy of 98.2{\%}, 97.9{\%} and 99.5{\%} for three periods and the validation overall accuracy were 91.5{\%}, 89.1{\%} and 97.6{\%}, respectively. Our findings suggest that L8 imagery and Google Earth Engine algorithm can be used to estimate area changes of mangrove forests in Cambodia with higher accuracy. The results of this study may be useful to assist decision making in planning for mangrove ecosystem restoration activities, evaluation of ecological services and in better estimation of carbon stock in mangrove forest.

In this study, we report a fusion method of freely accessed and global-scale Sentinel-2 (imagery) and Ice,Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) (laser altimetry) datasets for deriving tidal flat topography. The basic idea is to construct a model on characterizing the specific relationship between the elevations of the tidal flat (from ICESat-2 data) and corresponding inundation frequencies (from Sentinel-2 time-series). The proposed method was validated for the largest tidal flat on the Chinese continental shelf with a root mean square error of 0.23 m. We highlight that this method solely relies on satellite data and does not require any in-situ data because ICESat-2 provides dense and accurate along-track points as valuable prior elevation information, which enhance the ability to obtain tidal flat topography in many coastal regions even in the absence of local in-situ data.},

abstract = {After being launched in September 2018, measurements from the ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) will be available to the science community starting in the Spring of 2019. These data offer new possibilities for the mapping of global terrain and vegetation as well as monitoring of the Earth's carbon stocks. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument on-board ICESat-2 will utilize photon counting technology for the altimetry observations. Photon counting technology is relatively new to the vegetation mapping community thus requires development of new algorithm approaches for terrain surface and canopy height retrievals. Photon counting systems provide range measurements for individual photons given the instrument's detection sensitivity. The sensitivity enables higher laser repetition rates for improved spatial coverage but is susceptible to solar background noise making the separation of signal and noise challenging and the data volume large. The algorithm developed specifically for the extraction of terrain and canopy heights from the ATLAS point clouds produces the ATL08 geophysical data product. This paper provides a detailed description of the ATL08 methodology, presents the data format, discusses many of the critical parameters likely to be of interest to future ICESat-2 data users, and describes the predicated uncertainties for terrain and canopy heights using two simulated ATLAS data sets. The first critical function in the ATL08 algorithm needs to accurately retrieve the surface is to identify the signal photons apart from the noise photons. Using a series of iterative filters, the ground and top of canopy surfaces are then identified in the signal. Next, individual photons are classified as either noise, canopy, or ground photons based on their distance above (or below) the estimated ground and top of canopy surfaces. The ATL08 algorithm has been tested on several simulated ATLAS data sets, and the results from two different ecosystems are described. The terrain extraction results saw sub-meter RMSE for the Alaska Tundra/Taiga ecotone and {\textless}2 m RMSE in Sonoma County, California which is characterized by complex topography and dense vegetation. Although canopy heights on the ATL08 data product will underestimate the true canopy height within a segment, the ICESat-2 derived canopy height is found to be correlated with relative height metrics produced from airborne lidar (i.e. truth). For the sparse boreal forests of Alaska, the ATL08 canopy height was most correlated with the 95th percentile relative height (RH95). However, for the dense coniferous forests of Sonoma County, CA, ATL08 canopy height is correlated with 75th percentile relative height (RH75). Data from ICESat-2 will provide a new and exciting data set to the scientific community by providing global terrain and canopy height estimates as well as showing potential for estimation of forest biomass.},

abstract = {Shallow-water depth information is essential for ship navigation and fishery farming. However, the accurate acquisition of shallow-water depth has been a challenge for marine mapping. Combining Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) bathymetry data with multispectral data, satellite-derived bathymetry is a promising solution through which to obtain bathymetric information quickly and accurately. This study proposes a photon refraction correction method considering sea-surface undulations to address errors in the underwater photons obtained by the ICESat-2. First, the instantaneous sea surface and beam emission angle are integrated to determine the sea-surface incidence angle. Next, the distance of photon propagation in water is determined using sea-surface undulation and Snell's law. Finally, position correction is performed through geometric relationships. The corrected photons were combined with the multispectral data for bathymetric inversion, and a bathymetric map of the Yongle Atoll area was obtained. A bathymetric chart was created using the corrected photons and the multispectral data in the Yongle Atoll. Comparing the results of different refraction correction methods with the data measured shows that the refraction correction method proposed in this paper can effectively correct bathymetry errors: the root mean square error is 1.48 m and the R2 is 0.86.},

With climate change, mangrove loss may also result in less protection against coastal storms as well as sea-level rise, saline intrusion and erosion. Past valuations of the storm protection benefit of mangroves have relied on the second-best replacement cost method, such as estimating this protective value with the cost of building human-made storm barriers. More reliable methods instead model the production of the protection service of mangroves and estimate its value in terms of reducing the expected damages or deaths avoided by coastal communities. This paper reviews recent methods of valuing the storm protection service of mangroves and their role in protecting coastal areas and communities of tropical developing countries.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate wave attenuation caused by mangroves as a porous media. A 1-D mathematical model is derived by modifying the shallow water equations (SWEs). Two approaches are used to involve the existing of mangrove: friction term and diffusion term. The model will be solved analytically using the separation of variables method and numerically using a staggered finite volume method. From both methods, wave transmission coefficient will be obtained and used to observe the damping effect induced by the porous media. Several comparisons are shown to examine the accuracy and robustness of the derived numerical scheme. The results show that the friction coefficient, diffusion coefficient and vegetation's length have a significant effect on the transmission coefficient. Moreover, numerical observation is extended to a 2-D SWEs, where we conduct a numerical simulation over a real bathymetry profile. The results from the 2-D numerical scheme will be validated using the data obtained from the field measurement which took place in Demak, Central Java, Indonesia. The results from this research will be beneficial to determine the characteristics of porous structures used for coastal protection.},

This paper focusses on relations between vegetation densities, wave attenuation rates, sediment characteristics and sedimentation rates in mangroves. These processes were studied along two cross-shore transects through mangroves fringing estuaries in the southern Andaman region of Thailand. Volumetric vegetation densities in these mangroves were ranging up to 32‰, depending on the water depth. Generalized total wave attenuation rates increased from 0.002m−1 in the sparsely vegetated forest fringes with Avicennia and Sonneratia species, up to 0.012m−1 in the dense Rhizophora vegetation in the back of the forests. The total wave attenuation rates integrate effects of shoaling and energy losses due to various bio-physical interactions within the mangrove ecosystem. Wave attenuation in the mangroves is presumably dominated by energy losses due to vegetation drag, since wave attenuation due to bottom friction and viscous dissipation on the bare mudflats is significantly lower than those inside the mangrove vegetation. Additionally, wave attenuation in the mangroves was found to facilitate enhanced net sediment deposition and a gradual fining of the bed material. These findings corroborate the coastal defence function of mangroves by quantifying their contribution to wave attenuation and sediment trapping. The explicit linking of these properties to vegetation composition and structure facilitates modelling studies investigating the mechanisms determining the coastal defence capacities of mangroves.},

abstract = {Buoyancy input as fresh water exerts a stratifying influence in estuaries and adjacent coastal waters. Predicting the development and breakdown of such stratification is an inherently more difficult problem than that involved in the analogous case of stratification induced by surface heating because the buoyancy input originates at the lateral boundaries. In the approach adopted here, we have adapted the energy considerations used in the surface heating problem to describe the competition between the stabilizing effect of fresh water and the vertical mixing brought about by tidal and wind stirring. Freshwater input induces horizontal gradients which drive the estuarine circulation in which lighter fluid at the surface is moved seaward over heavier fluid moving landward below. This contribution to stratification is expected to vary in time as the level of turbulence varies over the tidal cycle. The density gradient also interacts directly with the vertical shear in the tidal current to induce a periodic input to stratification which is positive on the ebb phase of the tide. Comparison of this input with the available stirring energy leads to a simple criterion for the existence of strain-induced stratification. Observations in a region of Liverpool Bay satisfying this criterion confirm the occurrence of a strong semidiurnal variation in stratification with complete vertical mixing apparent around high water except at neap tides when more permanent stratification may develop. A simulation of the monthly cycle based on a model including straining, stirring, and the estuarine circulation is in qualitative agreement with the main features of the observations. {\textcopyright} 1990 Estuarine Research Federation.},

abstract = {The new generation of satellite-borne laser radar Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data has been successfully used for ground information acquisition. However, when dealing with complex terrain and dense vegetation cover, the accuracy of the extracted understory Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is limited. Therefore, this paper proposes a photon correction data processing method based on ICESat-2 to improve the DTM inversion accuracy in complex terrain and high forest coverage areas. The correction value is first extracted based on the ALOS PALSAR DEM reference data to correct the cross-track photon data of ICESat-2. The slope filter threshold is then selected from the reference data, and the extracted possible ground photons are slope filtered to obtain accurate ground photons. Finally, the impacts of cross-track photon and slope filtering on fine ground extraction from the ICESat-2 data are discussed. The results show that the proposed photon correction and slope filtering algorithms help to improve the extraction accuracy of forest DTM in complex terrain areas. Compared with the forest DTM extracted without the photon correction and slope filtering methods, the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are reduced by 51.90{\~{}}57.82{\%} and 49.37{\~{}}53.55{\%}, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that photon correction can improve the terrain inversion ability of ICESat-2, while providing a novel method for ground extraction based on ICESat-2 data. It provides a theoretical basis for the accurate inversion of canopy parameters for ICESat-2.},

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) loading to lakes is degrading the quality and usability of water globally. Accurate predictions of lake P dynamics are needed to understand whole-ecosystem P budgets, as well as the consequences of changing lake P concentrations for water quality. However, complex biophysical processes within lakes, along with limited observational data, challenge our capacity to reproduce short-term lake dynamics needed for water quality predictions, as well as long-term dynamics needed to understand broad scale controls over lake P. Here we use an emerging paradigm in modeling, process-guided machine learning (PGML), to produce a phosphorus budget for Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA) and to accurately predict epilimnetic phosphorus over a time range of days to decades. In our implementation of PGML, which we term a Process-Guided Recurrent Neural Network (PGRNN), we combine a process-based model for lake P with a recurrent neural network, and then constrain the predictions with ecological principles. We test independently the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN to evaluate the overall approach. The process-based model accounted for most of the observed pattern in lake P; however it missed the long-term trend in lake P and had the worst performance in predicting winter and summer P in surface waters. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN was 33.0 $\mu$g P L− 1, 22.7 $\mu$g P L− 1, and 20.7 $\mu$g P L− 1, respectively. All models performed better during summer, with RMSE values for the three models (same order) equal to 14.3 $\mu$g P L− 1, 10.9 $\mu$g P L− 1, and 10.7 $\mu$g P L− 1. Although the PGRNN had only marginally better RMSE during summer, it had lower bias and reproduced long-term decreases in lake P missed by the other two models. For all seasons and all years, the recurrent neural network had better predictions than process alone, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 23.8 $\mu$g P L− 1 and 28.0 $\mu$g P L− 1, respectively. The output of PGRNN indicated that new processes related to water temperature, thermal stratification, and long term changes in external loads are needed to improve the process model. By using ecological knowledge, as well as the information content of complex data, PGML shows promise as a technique for accurate prediction in messy, real-world ecological dynamics, while providing valuable information that can improve our understanding of process.},

abstract = {This article reviews river flood generation processes and flow paths across space scales. The scale steps include the pore, profile, hillslope, catchment, regional and continental scales, representing a scale range of a total of 10 orders of magnitude. Although the processes differ between the scales, there are notable similarities. At all scales, there are media patterns that control the flow of water and are themselves influenced by the flow of water. The processes are therefore not spatially random (as in thermodynamics) but organized, and preferential flow is the rule rather than the exception. Hydrological connectivity, i.e. the presence of coherent flow paths, is an essential characteristic at all scales. There are similar controls on water flow and thus on flood generation at all scales but with different relative magnitudes. Processes at lower scales affect flood generation at larger scales, not simply as a multiple repetition of pore-scale processes but through interactions which cause emergent behaviour of process patterns. For this reason, when modelling these processes, the scale transitions need to be simplified in a way that reflects the relevant structures (e.g. connectivity) and boundary conditions (e.g. groundwater table) at each scale. In conclusion, it is argued that upscaling as the mere multiple application of small-scale process descriptions will not capture the larger-scale patterns of flood generation. Instead, there is a need to learn from observed patterns of flood generation processes at all spatial scales.},

These shorter-period processes, like seiches, meteotsunamis, infragravity and coastal waves, may even dominate in low tidal basins.

abstract = {Incorporating the values of the services that ecosystems provide into decision making is becoming increasingly common in nature conservation and resource management policies, both locally and globally. Yet with limited funds for conservation of threatened species and ecosystems there is a desire to identify priority areas where investment efficiently conserves multiple ecosystem services. We mapped four mangrove ecosystems services (coastal protection, fisheries, biodiversity, and carbon storage) across Fiji. Using a costeffectiveness analysis, we prioritised mangrove areas for each service, where the effectiveness was a function of the benefits provided to the local communities, and the costs were associated with restricting specific uses of mangroves. We demonstrate that, although priority mangrove areas (top 20{\%}) for each service can be managed at relatively low opportunity costs (ranging from 4.5 to 11.3{\%} of overall opportunity costs), prioritising for a single service yields relatively low co-benefits due to limited geographical overlap with priority areas for other services. None-the-less, prioritisation of mangrove areas provides greater overlap of benefits than if sites were selected randomly for most ecosystem services. We discuss deficiencies in the mapping of ecosystems services in data poor regions and how this may impact upon the equity of managing mangroves for particular services across the urbanrural divide in developing countries. Finally we discuss how our maps may aid decisionmakers to direct funding for mangrove management from various sources to localities that best meet funding objectives, as well as how this knowledge can aid in creating a national mangrove zoning scheme.},

NPBNs allow for a system-level probabilistic description of vegetated hydrodynamic systems, generate physically realistic varied boundary conditions for physical or numerical modeling, provide missing information in data-scarce environments, and reduce the amount of numerical simulations required to obtain generalized results—all of which are critically useful to pave the way for successful implementation of nature-based solutions.},

Traditional methods such as ground, ship-borne, and airborne surveys suffer from limited spatial coverage and temporal sampling due to logistical constraints and high costs which limit their ability to provide the needed information. The recent advancements of spaceborne remote sensing techniques, along with their ability to acquire data over large spatial areas and to provide high frequency temporal monitoring, has made them very attractive for topography and bathymetry mapping. In this review, we present an overview of the current state of spaceborne-based remote sensing techniques used to estimate the topography and bathymetry of beaches, intertidal, and nearshore areas.

abstract = {Although several damaged mangrove ecosystems have been restored worldwide, so far, it has not been established whether a restored mangrove system regains all the functional properties of preserved mangroves. This study measured nitrogen fixation as an indicator of whether disturbed mangroves that were reforested or naturally regenerated fully recovered from this disturbance at a functional level. Rates of nitrogen fixation were measured for one year in impaired, preserved, reforested, and naturally regenerated mangroves dominated by the black mangrove (Avicennia germinans). There was no significant difference in rates of nitrogen fixation among preserved and adjacent reforested and naturally regenerated mangroves, but a significant reduction occurred in an impaired mangrove. Nitrogen fixation was mainly controlled by pH, salinity, and temperature. The highest rates of nitrogen fixation occurred in summer at pH values less than 6.4, whereas the impaired mangrove had higher pH and salinity and had very low nitrogen fixation activity. These results suggest that nitrogen fixation can be used as an ecological indicator of the success of reforestation and as a sensitive measure of perturbations in mangroves. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract = {Wave attenuation was studied in a coastal mangrove system in the Red River Delta, Vietnam on the coast north of Do Son. From sea towards land the study area consisted of a bare mudflat, covered by a sandy layer with embryonic cheniers, abruptly changing into a muddy tidal flat overgrown with mangroves. Three instrumented tripods (A-C) placed in a cross-shore profile, were used to measure current velocity and water level, at the open tidal flat, at the beginning of the mangrove vegetation, and in the mangrove vegetation, respectively. Measurements were conducted in the wet season in July and August 2000. The elevation of the area was surveyed using a levelling instrument. Over the bare sandy surface of the mudflat, the incoming waves are reduced in height (and energy density) due to bottom friction. This reduction decreases with increasing water depth. In the mangrove vegetation, the bottom friction exerted by the clay particles is very low. However, the dense network of trunks, branches and above ground roots of the mangrove vegetation causes a much higher drag force. For the mangrove vegetation which mainly consists of Kandelia candel, the drag force can be approached by the function CD = 0.6e0.15A (with A being the projected cross-sectional area of the under water obstacles at a certain water depth). For the same muddy surface without mangroves the function would be CD = 0.6. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To derive shallow water bathymetry for coastal areas, a common approach is to deploy a scanning airborne bathymetric light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system or a shipborne echosounder for ground surveys. However, recent advancements in satellite remote sensing, including the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) offer new tools for generating satellite derived bathymetry (SDB). The key payload onboard ICESat-2 is the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a micro-pulse, photon-counting LiDAR system, simultaneously emitting six separate 532 nm beams at 10 kHz pulse rate. However, despite its high resolution, the major limitation for bathymetry is that ICESat-2 only provides along-track height profiles, leaving observation gaps between the parallel ground tracks. Merging ICESat-2 observations with optical multispectral imagery, as demonstrated herein, provides an effective solution for deriving a full scene of water depth in light of the spectral attenuation behavior. This study aims to combine ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 optical data to derive shallow water bathymetry (depth {\textless}20 m) at six islands and reefs in the South China Sea. ICESat-2 ATL03 point clouds of georeferenced photons are first filtered to determine the seafloor elevation along the ground track. Results indicate a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.26–0.61 m as compared with independent observations from an airborne LiDAR campaign. Next, three semi-empirical functions, namely the Modified Linear/Polynomial/Exponential Ratio Models with its kernel formed by the log ratio between Sentinel-2′s green and blue bands, are used to fit the spectral data with ICESat-2 height profiles. After water depth mapping using the trained model, independent ICESat-2 point clouds are used to validate the Sentinel-2 derived bathymetry. The RMSE values of the three models using the weighted average of multiple images for these six islands are within 0.50–0.90 m in 0–15 m deep. We also demonstrate that a synthesis of satellite laser altimetry and optical remote sensing can produce SDB results that potentially meet the requirement of category C in Zones of Confidence (ZOC) of the Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) in 0–8 m deep. It is foreseen that ICESat-2 will be a helpful tool for mapping coastal and shallow waters around the world especially where bathymetric data are unavailable.},

abstract = {Bundling techniques provide a visual simplification of a graph drawing or trail set, by spatially grouping similar graph edges or trails. This way, the structure of the visualization becomes simpler and thereby easier to comprehend in terms of assessing relations that are encoded by such paths, such as finding groups of strongly interrelated nodes in a graph, finding connections between spatial regions on a map linked by a number of vehicle trails, or discerning the motion structure of a set of objects by analyzing their paths. In this state of the art report, we aim to improve the understanding of graph and trail bundling via the following main contributions. First, we propose a data-based taxonomy that organizes bundling methods on the type of data they work on (graphs vs trails, which we refer to as paths). Based on a formal definition of path bundling, we propose a generic framework that describes the typical steps of all bundling algorithms in terms of high-level operations and show how existing method classes implement these steps. Next, we propose a description of tasks that bundling aims to address. Finally, we provide a wide set of example applications of bundling techniques and relate these to the above-mentioned taxonomies. Through these contributions, we aim to help both researchers and users to understand the bundling landscape as well as its technicalities.},

The model depends on a single parameter similar to the drag coefficient, which is parameterized as a function of the local Keulegan – Carpenter number for a specific type of plant.

abstract = {The importance of mangrove forest as a natural protection system has been a focused interest especially after the 2004 tsunami. It was reported that human deaths and property losses were reduced in areas of dense mangrove forests. Devastating incidents in recent years due to extreme environmental and catastrophic conditions that lead to various degrees of damages in the coastal areas have significantly increased awareness on the role of mangrove forests as ecoengineering approach to coastal stability and defense. With the recent urge for mangroves protection and replanting, a sound basis for a more optimum strategy in maintaining mangroves as coastal protection buffer is inevitably required. Hence, this study is aimed to quantify the reduction of wave height by 10 years old mangroves with various densities and tree arrangements. The laboratory experiments were conducted in a narrow wave flume using artificial mangrove models. The results showed that wave height reduction in areas of 100 m width of 10 years old mangroves was 2.5 times more effective as compared to areas without mangroves. Earlier investigation revealed that for areas with 20 years old mangroves was able to dissipate waves four times greater compared to areas without mangroves. For areas with 200 m width of 10 years old mangroves, a density of 0.11 trees/m2 is sufficient to reduce wave height over 77{\%}. With a difference of less than 3{\%}, the investigation also revealed no significant difference of wave reduction between tandem and staggered arrangements when the mangroves are of 10 years old. {\textcopyright} (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Around the world, the effects of changing plant phenology are evident in many ways: from earlier and longer growing seasons to altering the relationships between plants and their natural pollinators. Plant phenology is often monitored using satellite images and parametric methods. Parametric methods assume that ecosystems have unimodal phenologies and that the phenology model is invariant through space and time. In evergreen ecosystems such as mangrove forests, these assumptions may not hold true. Here we present a novel, data-driven approach to extract plant phenology from Landsat imagery using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Using GAMs, we created models for six different mangrove forests across Australia. In contrast to parametric methods, GAMs let the data define the shape of the phenological curve, hence showing the unique characteristics of each study site. We found that the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) model is related to leaf production rate (from in situ data), leaf gain and net leaf production (from the published literature). We also found that EVI does not respond immediately to leaf gain in most cases, but has a two- to three-month lag. We also identified the start of season and peak growing season dates at our field site. The former occurs between September and October and the latter May and July. The GAMs allowed us to identify dual phenology events in our study sites, indicated by two instances of high EVI and two instances of low EVI values throughout the year. We contribute to a better understanding of mangrove phenology by presenting a data-driven method that allows us to link physical changes of mangrove forests with satellite imagery. In the future, we will use GAMs to (1) relate phenology to environmental variables (e.g., temperature and rainfall) and (2) predict phenological changes.},

Present study uses two dimensional flow routing capabilities of Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) for flood inundation mapping in lower region of Brazo River watershed subjected to frequent flooding. For analysis, river reach length of 20 km located at Richmond, Texas, was considered. Detailed underlying terrain information available from digital elevation model of 1/9-arc second resolution was used to generate the two-dimensional (2D) flow area and flow geometrics. Streamflow data available from gauging station USGS08114000 was used for the full unsteady flow hydraulic modeling along the reach. Developed hydraulic model was then calibrated based on the manning's roughness coefficient for the river reach by comparison with the downstream rating curve. Corresponding water surface elevation and velocity distribution obtained after 2D hydraulic simulation were used to determine the extent of flooding. For this, RAS mapper's capabilities of inundation mapping in HEC-RAS itself were used. Mapping of the flooded areas based on inflow hydrograph on each time step were done in RAS mapper, which provided the spatial distribution of flow. The results from this study can be used for flood management as well as for making land use and infrastructure development decisions.},

abstract = {Nearshore estimates of bathymetry are crucial for understanding coastal processes. However, current passive remote sensing methods for estimating bathymetry require in situ depth measurements to train inversion models, which can be difficult or impossible to obtain in many areas. To address this issue, we investigated the fusion of range measurements from the advanced topographic laser altimeter system (ATLAS) aboard the NASA ICESat-2 satellite, and multispectral satellite imagery from European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 using two common bathymetric inversion algorithms. The active ranging capability of the ATLAS green (532-nm) laser has been shown to generate returns of up to 38-m depth in optically clear waters, providing depth measurements to constrain passive bathymetric inversion results. Data acquired in November 2018 over the nearshore in Destin, FL, USA, offer a proof of concept for this approach. The results of the bathymetric inversion were quantitatively assessed by comparison with airborne bathymetric LiDAR collected using the U.S. Army Corps Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging LiDAR (CZMIL) system in October-November 2018. Overall, the results of the bathymetric inversion compared with the CZMIL data have a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.35 m in waters with similar turbidity and bottom reflectivity, and demonstrate that a combination of ICESat-2 depth observations with Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery can estimate seamless nearshore bathymetry for optically clear coastal waters.},

However, given the lack of quantitative evidence of their performance in such extreme events, tree belts have been criticized for creating a false sense of security. This study used 180 transects perpendicular to over 100 km on the west coast of Aceh, Indonesia to analyze the influence of coastal vegetation, particularly cultivated trees, on the impact of the 2004 tsunami. Satellite imagery; land cover maps; land use characteristics; stem diameter, height, and planting density; and a literature review were used to develop a land cover roughness coefficient accounting for the resistance offered by different land uses to the wave advance. Applying a spatial generalized linear mixed model, we found that while distance to coast was the dominant determinant of impact (casualties and infrastructure damage), the existing coastal vegetation in front of settlements also significantly reduced casualties by an average of 5{\%}. In contrast, dense vegetation behind villages endangered human lives and increased structural damage. Debris carried by the backwash may have contributed to these dissimilar effects of land cover. For sustainable and effective coastal risk management, location of settlements is essential, while the protective potential of coastal vegetation, as determined by its spatial arrangement, should be regarded as an important livelihood provider rather than just as a bioshield.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A three-part algorithm is described and tested to provide robust bathymetry maps based solely on long time series observations of surface wave motions. The first phase consists of frequency-dependent characterization of the wave field in which dominant frequencies are estimated by Fourier transform while corresponding wave numbers are derived from spatial gradients in cross-spectral phase over analysis tiles that can be small, allowing high-spatial resolution. Coherent spatial structures at each frequency are extracted by frequency-dependent empirical orthogonal function (EOF). In phase two, depths are found that best fit weighted sets of frequency-wave number pairs. These are subsequently smoothed in time in phase 3 using a Kalman filter that fills gaps in coverage and objectively averages new estimates of variable quality with prior estimates. Objective confidence intervals are returned. Tests at Duck, NC, using 16 surveys collected over 2 years showed a bias and root-mean-square (RMS) error of 0.19 and 0.51 m, respectively but were largest near the offshore limits of analysis (roughly 500 m from the camera) and near the steep shoreline where analysis tiles mix information from waves, swash and static dry sand. Performance was excellent for small waves but degraded somewhat with increasing wave height. Sand bars and their small-scale alongshore variability were well resolved. A single ground truth survey from a dissipative, low-sloping beach (Agate Beach, OR) showed similar errors over a region that extended several kilometers from the camera and reached depths of 14 m. Vector wave number estimates can also be incorporated into data assimilation models of nearshore dynamics. {\textcopyright}2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

Results reveal stark regional patterns of changing ﬂood risk that are broadly consistent above the four ﬂood categories. We show that these patterns are dependent on the overall wetness and potential water storage, with fundamental implications for water resources management, agriculture, insurance, navigation, ecology, and populations living in ﬂood-affected areas.

abstract = {Despite the acceleration of climate change, erroneous assumptions of climate stationarity are still inculcated in the management of water resources in the United States (US). The US system for drought detection, which triggers billions of dollars in emergency resources, adheres to this assumption with preference towards 60-year (or longer) record lengths for drought characterization. Using observed data from 1,934 Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN) sites across the US, we show that conclusions based on long climate records can substantially bias assessment of drought severity. Bias emerges by assuming that conditions from the early and mid 20th century are as likely to occur in today's climate. Numerical simulations reveal that drought assessment error is relatively low with limited climatology lengths ({\~{}}30 year) and that error increases with longer record lengths where climate is changing rapidly. We assert that non-stationarity in climate must be accounted for in contemporary assessments to more accurately portray present drought risk. Climate has changed over the last century, yet this change is seldom accounted for in drought assessment. This study quantifies drought bias due to climate change and suggests adjustment to align monitoring with contemporary risk.},

abstract = {Aim: Since decades, a major part of south-western coastal region of Bangladesh is being affected by water logging – a problem related to climate change along with some manmade activities. Therefore, the study was conducted to assess the causes and consequences of this problem and highlights the responses of affected people to attract policy planners' intention for taking proper intervention. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted in the Laboratory of Plant Ecology, Department of Crop Botany, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, Bangladesh. Methodology: Qualitative and quantitative techniques have been applied to collect and analyze both the primary and secondary sources of data from various waterlogged areas of south west Bangladesh. Results: There is no single or a few factors are responsible for creating water-logging problem rather it is a combination of several factors and their cumulative effects over time. It is revealed from the analysis of primary and secondary sources of information that death of Mathavanga River in the 20th century, execution of Coastal Embankment Project since 1960's, withdrawing water flow to the Padma River through operating the Farakka barrage after independent of Bangladesh, improper management of rivers, faulty land-use by influential people in the areas, monsoon downpour etc are major causes of the problem. The silted up river systems in area could not drain monsoon rain that occurred even for a couple of days. The consequences brought to inundate hundred thousand hectares of cultivable land unsuitable for crop production. More than one million people are directly affected in the areas and the number is gradually increasing over the years. Water stagnancy around the settlement areas remains 6 to 9 months in a year and many places became permanently waterlogged. The affected people have no other way out but to live with water. The congested water is polluted with salinity, chemical effluents with heavy metals, household debris's and related other pollutants. Source of safe drinking water is destroyed. Therefore incidences of waterborne and skin diseases are increased. People are living with greatest inhumanity as food, shelter, sanitation, communications, educations and other prime needs are tremendously challenged. Many people lost their occupations and became destitute, some altered their livelihood to much lower grades, and many of them are forced to migrate to city areas. The marooned people demanded to the authority to declare their places as an affected area and sought the government intervention to bring an end to the crisis through operating the Tidal River Management plan and excavating or re-excavating of associated rivers, channels and rivulets. Conclusion: The authority need to pay keen attention to the issue and should take proper initiative to mitigate the water-logging problem permanently to save people living in the south western coastal region of Bangladesh.},

abstract = {The Global Storm Surge Forecasting and Information System is a first-of-its-kind operational forecasting system for storm surge prediction on a global scale, taking into account tidal and extra-tropical storm events in real time. The system, built and hosted by Deltares, provides predictions of water level and surge height up to 10 days in advance from numerical simulations and measurement data integrated within an operational IT environment. The Delft-FEWS software provides the operational environment in which wind forecasts and measurement data are collected and processed, and serves as a platform from which to run the numerical model. The global Delft3D model is built on a spherical, flexible mesh with a resolution around 5 km in near-shore coastal waters and an offshore resolution of 50 km to provide detailed information at the coast while limiting the computational time required. By using a spherical grid, the model requires no external boundary conditions. Numerical global wind forecasts are used as forcing for the model, with plans to incorporate regional meteorological forecasts to better capture smaller, tropical storms using the Wind Enhanced Scheme for generation of tropical winds (WES). The system will be automated to collect regional wind forecasts and storm warning bulletins which are incorporated directly into the model calculations. The forecasting system provides real-time water level and surge information in areas that currently lack local storm surge prediction capability. This information is critical for coastal communities in planning their flood strategy and during disaster response. The system is also designed to supply boundary conditions for coupling finer-scale regional models. The Global Storm Surge Forecasting and Information System is run within the Deltares iD-Lab initiative aiming at collaboration with universities, consultants and interested organizations. The results of the system will be made available via standards such as netCDF-CF, OpenDAP, WaterML2 and/or JSON REST as an interoperability experiment.},

abstract = {Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forested wetlands with the highest carbon (C) density of all terrestrial ecosystems. Because of their exceptionally large C stocks and importance as a coastal buffer, their protection and restoration has been proposed as an effective mitigation strategy for climate change. The inclusion of mangroves in mitigation strategies requires the quantification of C stocks (both above and belowground) and changes to accurately calculate emissions and sequestration. A growing number of countries are becoming interested in using mitigation initiatives, such as REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), in these unique coastal forests. However, it is not yet clear how methods to measure C traditionally used for other ecosystems can be modified to estimate biomass in mangroves with the precision and accuracy needed for these initiatives. Airborne Lidar (ALS) data has often been proposed as the most accurate way for larger scale assessments but the application of ALS for coastal wetlands is scarce, primarily due to a lack of contemporaneous ALS and field measurements. Here, we evaluated the variability in field and Lidar-based estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) through the combination of different local and regional allometric models and standardized height metrics that are comparable across spatial resolutions and sensor types, the end result being a simplified approach for accurately estimating mangrove AGB at large scales and determining the uncertainty by combining multiple allometric models. We then quantified wall-to-wall AGB stocks of a tall mangrove forest in the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique. Our results indicate that the Lidar H100 height metric correlates well with AGB estimates, with R 2 between 0.80 and 0.88 and RMSE of 33{\%} or less. When comparing Lidar H100 AGB derived from three allometric models, mean AGB values range from 192 Mg ha-1 up to 252 Mg ha-1. We suggest the best model to predict AGB was based on the East Africa specific allometry and a power-based regression that used Lidar H100 as the height input with an R 2 of 0.85 and an RMSE of 122 Mg ha-1 or 33{\%}. The total AGB of the Lidar inventoried mangrove area (6654 ha) was 1 350 902 Mg with a mean AGB of 203 Mg ha-1 ± 166 Mg ha-1. Because the allometry suggested here was developed using standardized height metrics, it is recommended that the models can generate AGB estimates using other remote sensing instruments that are more readily accessible over other mangrove ecosystems on a large scale, and as part of future carbon monitoring efforts in mangroves.},

abstract = {Information of the water depth in coastal areas is important for navigation, risk assessment, disaster mitigation, coastal environmental management, marine habitat monitoring, and many other activities. Spaceborne shallow water bathymetry mapping has been an emerging practice to estimate the water depth where there are limited field data points. In this study, we evaluated five purely-spaceborne satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) methods, namely clustered-based Lyzenga with 3 different regression functions (multilinear, robust multilinear, and ridge), Support Vector Machine regression, and Random Forest regression using multitemporal Sentinel-2 composites that were synthesized from over 800 images. We test these methods at the national-scale of Belize in optically shallow waters between the depth of 0 and 10 m and over 6,690 sq. km. We employed 641,562 bathymetry transect points derived from ICESat-2 ATL03 LiDAR (IS2) platform stratified within 2-m-interval to train the model and validated it with 3,100 field data acquired with CAMELS, Multibeam, and LiDAR sensors. We compared the performance of these five methods for SDB mapping by assessing the following error metrics: root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean error (µ), and coefficient of determination (R2) over 2-m depth intervals as well. Our results show that the clustered-based Lyzenga method with multi-linear regression yields the best result, with error less than 10{\%} of the maximum depth below the depth of 8 m. Beyond the depth of 8 m, the IS2-trained models tend to underestimate the depth when compared to the field data. This could show the lower sensitivity of the IS2 sensor on the deeper waters. We discuss preliminary benefits and challenges of big satellite data analytics, empirical and machine learning methods, and ICESat-2 data for national-scale satellite-derived bathymetry estimation.},

abstract = {With the aim of better understand and parameterize the physical processes involved in flow-mangrove interaction, wave attenuation and drag forces along a 1:6 scale fringe Rhizophora mangrove forest are studied experimentally. The 26 m long forest is composed by 135 models built reproducing mature Rhizophora mangrove trees with 24 prop roots. Hydrodynamic conditions are scaled using Froude similarity based on values collected in nature. Regular and random waves are tested and three water depths are considered to account for the influence of variable mangroves frontal area along the vertical. Wave decay analysis highlights the importance of considering the effect of flume bottom and walls friction. Neglecting this additional damping can result in a high overestimation of the mangrove dissipation capacity. It is proven that water depth, and the associated mangroves frontal area, and wave height are the dominant variables driving wave attenuation for short waves. The slope seaward the forest induces wave shoaling leading to an increase of wave steepness. Accordingly, the exerted forces on the mangroves also increase along the first 3–4 m of the forest. Smaller forces are recorded further into the forest where wave decay formulations fit well to the recorded wave heights. In general, analytical drag forces obtained by using mangrove trees induced damping coefficients compare well to the forces measured within the forest. However, analytical drag forces can lead to overestimations of up to double in some cases. This aspect is very important when experimental results are used to feed numerical or analytical models based on the introduction of a drag force in the momentum equation. These models should be calibrated using, whenever possible, direct force measurements.},

Correlations were also assessed between mangrove species composition and edaphic variables that co-vary with elevation, i.e. salinity, field capacity, cation exchange capacity, percentage silt, and mangrove physiognomic category (slope, basin, levee and flat). 4. Quantitative statistical analysis using randomization techniques failed to detect species zonation along any of 33 individual 200-m transects, within 1-km2 blocks, or within 1200-km2 regions. 5. Canonical correspondence analysis relating edaphic variables to species distributions accounted for a total of only 24{\%} of the variance in species composition. 6.

This ensures coastal resilience and provision of essential ecosystem services, such as wave attenuation reducing coastal flooding and erosion. In the continuum from unvegetated tidal flats to salt marshes and mangroves, fundamental physical controls as well as biotic interactions, and feedbacks among them, determine morphology and vegetation distribution. Although these processes are well described in established literature, this information is rarely applied to understanding the role of these ecosystems as coastal defense. The focus is often on specific elements of the complex system, such as vegetation structure and cover, rather than on their complex natural dynamics. This review examines whether and how the dynamic nature of tidal flat - wetlands systems contributes to, or detracts from, their role in coastal defense. It discusses how the characteristics of the system adjust to external forcing and how these adjustments affect ecosystem services. It also considers how human interventions can take advantage of natural processes to enhance or accelerate achievement of natural coastal defense.},

abstract = {A standard algorithm for determining depth in clear water from passive sensors exists; but it requires tuning of five parameters and does not retrieve depths where the bottom has an extremely low albedo. To address these issues, we developed an empirical solution using a ratio of reflectances that has only two tunable parameters and can be applied to low-albedo features. The two algorithms - the standard linear transform and the new ratio transform - were compared through analysis of IKONOS satellite imagery against lidar bathymetry. The coefficients for the ratio algorithm were tuned manually to a few depths from a nautical chart, yet performed as well as the linear algorithm tuned using multiple linear regression against the lidar. Both algorithms compensate for variable bottom type and albedo (sand, pavement, algae, coral) and retrieve bathymetry in water depths of less than 10-15 m. However, the linear transform does not distinguish depths {\textgreater} 15 m and is more subject to variability across the studied atolls. The ratio transform can, in clear water, retrieve depths in {\textgreater} 25 m of water and shows greater stability between different areas. It also performs slightly better in scattering turbidity than the linear transform. The ratio algorithm is somewhat noisier and cannot always adequately resolve fine morphology (structures smaller than 4-5 pixels) in water depths {\textgreater} 15-20 m. In general, the ratio transform is more robust than the linear transform.},

abstract = {Coral reefs can provide significant coastal protection benefits to people and property. Here we show that the annual expected damages from flooding would double, and costs from frequent storms would triple without reefs. For 100-year storm events, flood damages would increase by 91{\%} to {\$}US 272 billion without reefs. The countries with the most to gain from reef management are Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Mexico, and Cuba; annual expected flood savings exceed {\$}400 M for each of these nations. Sea-level rise will increase flood risk, but substantial impacts could happen from reef loss alone without better near-term management. We provide a global, process-based valuation of an ecosystem service across an entire marine biome at (sub)national levels. These spatially explicit benefits inform critical risk and environmental management decisions, and the expected benefits can be directly considered by governments (e.g., national accounts, recovery plans) and businesses (e.g., insurance).},

abstract = {Mangroves have been proven to be effective in storm surge attenuation but it remains an important challenge to accurately quantify such bio-shielding effects using numerical simulations, as it is very difficult to comprehensively represent the ecological characteristics of mangroves at both large and small scales. In this study, a numerical method is developed and implemented in the Coastal and Estuarine Storm Tide (CEST) model in order to investigate the attenuation effect of mangroves on storm surge. This numerical method employs an improved drag force formula, which involves the development of new abstract tree models and use of a landscape scale data map of mean mangrove tree height for the study area. The storm surge observed in the South Florida mangrove zone caused by Hurricane Wilma (2005) is used to verify the numerical model. The numerical results indicate a maximum surge of approximately 4.3 m, and a decay rate of peak storm surge height of approximately 18 cm/km across the areas with a mixture of mangrove islands and open water, and nearly 24 cm/km through areas with dense mangrove forest. Results also show that short mangroves ({\textless} 4 m) can outperform tall mangroves on surge attenuation when the water depth is low ({\textless} 4 m). Extensive comparisons are also made with the conventional Manning coefficient based method that incorporates the mangrove drag force into bed friction; it is found that the current method predicts better inundation extents for Wilma (2005), hence a more accurate quantification of the attenuation of storm surge due to mangroves.},

abstract = {Wave dissipation by drag forces is considered the dominant wave transformation process in fringe mangroves even though other process may be present. Furthermore, mangrove loss generates vertical erosion and changes in the nearshore profile that can affect wave breaking, whereas changes in vegetation density owing to species composition or disturbances may affect drag dissipation. The aim of this study is to identify local and global geographical control factors of wave attenuation in mangrove environments and to assess the effect of nearshore profile modifications by mangrove loss on wave breaking dissipation. Bottom wave attenuation from breaking and shoaling, the total wave energy attenuation rate, and wave reflection were estimated using modeling, pressure sensors, and reflection coefficients, respectively, at sites with contrasting wave power, bathymetric slope changes, vegetation density, and logging disturbance. Wave breaking changes by mangrove loss were estimated using wave evolution modeling under three successive slope increments by 0.7{\%} in two background mangrove nearshore profiles. The wave energy attenuation rate at the study sites was affected by incident wave height (28–76{\%}), epiphytic oyster presence, vegetation density, tidal inundation (41–55{\%}), and wave reflection from cliffs. The last two variables explained the wave attenuation rate variability at a cliffed study site (61–70{\%}), whereas the last three variables explained the wave attenuation rate variability on a global scale (92{\%}). Wave attenuation rates by vegetation and bottom friction were underestimated (2–59{\%} from global scale data) when wave shoaling was not considered. The wave energy increased or moved further inland in unvegetated scenarios in comparison with vegetated shores. In addition to drag forces, mangroves can promote wave attenuation by inducing friction, wave breaking, and wave reflection from prop-roots epiphytic organisms, shallow nearshore profiles, and cliffed edges, respectively.},

abstract = {Changes in driving and resistive stresses play an essential role in governing the buoyancy forces that are important controls on the speed and irreversibility of tidewater glacier retreats. We describe changes in geometry, velocity, and strain rate and present a top-down force balance analysis performed over the lower reach of Columbia Glacier. Our analysis uses new measurements and estimates of basal topography and photogrammetric surface velocity measurements made between 1977 and 2001, while assuming depth-independent strain. Sensitivity tests show that the method is robust and insensitive to small changes in the calculation parameters. Spatial distributions of ice speed show little correspondence with driving stress. Instead, spatial patterns of ice speed exhibit a nonlinear correspondence with basal drag. Primary resistance to flow comes from basal drag, but lateral drag becomes increasingly more important throughout the retreat, which may account for observed increases in speed. Maximum basal drag is always located in a prominent constriction located ∼12 km upstream from the preretreat terminus. Once the terminus retreated into deep water off the terminal moraine marking the modern maximum extent, the upstream location of this maximum basal drag helped to promote thinning and decrease effective pressure in the lower region by limiting replenishing ice flow from upstream. An increase in both ice velocity and calving resulted, initiating what appears to be an irreversible retreat. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems dominate the coastal wetlands of tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. They provide various ecological and economical ecosystem services contributing to coastal erosion protection, water filtration, provision of areas for fish and shrimp breeding, provision of building material and medicinal ingredients, and the attraction of tourists, amongst many other factors. At the same time, mangroves belong to the most threatened and vulnerable ecosystems worldwide and experienced a dramatic decline during the last half century. International programs, such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands or the Kyoto Protocol, underscore the importance of immediate protection measures and conservation activities to prevent the further loss of mangroves. In this context, remote sensing is the tool of choice to provide spatio-temporal information on mangrove ecosystem distribution, species differentiation, health status, and ongoing changes of mangrove populations. Such studies can be based on various sensors, ranging from aerial photography to high- and medium-resolution optical imagery and from hyperspectral data to active microwave (SAR) data. Remote-sensing techniques have demonstrated a high potential to detect, identify, map, and monitor mangrove conditions and changes during the last two decades, which is reflected by the large number of scientific papers published on this topic. To our knowledge, a recent review paper on the remote sensing of mangroves does not exist, although mangrove ecosystems have become the focus of attention in the context of current climate change and discussions of the services provided by these ecosystems. Also, climate change-related remote-sensing studies in coastal zones have increased drastically in recent years. The aim of this review paper is to provide a comprehensive overview and sound summary of all of the work undertaken, addressing the variety of remotely sensed data applied for mangrove ecosystem mapping, as well as the numerous methods and techniques used for data analyses, and to further discuss their potential and limitations.},

Here we find that the globally aggregated annual overtopping hours have increased by almost 50{\%} over the last two decades. A first-pass future assessment indicates that globally aggregated annual overtopping hours will accelerate faster than the global mean sea-level rise itself, with a clearly discernible increase occurring around mid-century regardless of climate scenario. Under RCP 8.5, the globally aggregated annual overtopping hours by the end of the 21st-century is projected to be up to 50 times larger compared to present-day. As sea level continues to rise, more regions around the world are projected to become exposed to coastal overtopping.},

The response consists of changes in properties such as cross-sectional shape and area, slope, planform pattern, bed roughness and bed sediment composition. Usually, attention for the morphological impact of engineering works focuses on short-term effects. The usually much slower, but also much more persistent large-scale response is often ignored, or countermeasures are ineffective. In many cases this has led to extra maintenance costs, in some even to hazardous situations or disaster. This paper refreshes and extends long-existing but seemingly forgotten knowledge on large-scale river behaviour. It gives examples of impacts of engineering works, climate change and sea level rise, discusses potential countermeasures and gives a number of general conclusions on the large-scale morphological behaviour of lowland rivers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This part contains a review of elementary theory for water waves, chapters on the turbulent wave boundary layer and the turbulent interaction between waves and currents, and finally, surf zone hydrodynamics and wave driven currents. The second part covers sediment transport and morphological development.The part on sediment transport introduces the basic concepts (critical bed shear stress, bed load, suspended load and sheet layer, near-bed concentration, effect of sloping bed); it treats suspended sediment in waves and current and in the surf zone, and current and wave-generated bed forms.

abstract = {Mangrove-mud coasts across the world erode because of uninformed management, conversion of mangrove forests into aquaculture ponds, development of infrastructure and urbanization, and/or extraction of groundwater inducing land subsidence. The accompanied loss of ecosystem values, amongst which safety against flooding, has far reaching consequences for coastal communities, exacerbated by sea-level rise. To halt erosion various nature-based solutions have been implemented as an alternative to hard infrastructure sea defenses, including mangrove planting and erection of low-tech structures such as bamboo fences, permeable brushwood dams, etc. These structures have been designed on the basis of best-engineering practice, lacking sufficient scientific background. This paper investigates the use and success of permeable dams over a period of about 15 years, describing their application in Guyana, Indonesia, Suriname, Thailand and Vietnam, summarizing the lessons-learned, and analyzing their functioning in relation to the physical-biological coastal system. Also an overview of relevant costs is given. The basic philosophy behind the construction of permeable dams is the rehabilitation of mangrove habitat through re-establishment of the (fine) sediment dynamics – we refer to Building with Nature as the overarching principle of this approach. Our main conclusions are that a successful functioning of permeable dams requires (1) a thorough understanding of the physical-biological system and analysis of the relevant processes, (2) patience and persistence, including maintenance, as the natural time scales to rehabilitate mangrove green belts take years to decades, and (3) intensive stakeholder involvement. We give a list of conditions under which permeable dams may be successful, but in qualitative terms, as local site conditions largely govern their success or failure.},

The world's first photon-counting laser altimetry satellite, the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), which was launched in 2018, has proven to have a certain bathymetric capability, which provides a new means for the surveying of island and reef zones. However, how to accurately extract and separate land surface signal photons, sea surface signal photons, and seafloor signal photons in these areas has not yet been resolved. In this paper, we propose a validated auto-adaptive multi-level classification algorithm (AMSRLC), which can realize automatic recognition and classification of seafloor, sea surface, and land surface photons in island and reef zones. A overlapping histogram, a slope-adaptive search ellipse, and a water depth adaptive local signal-to-noise ratio are respectively used to extract flat sea surface signals, island and reef surface signals with slope changes, and seafloor signals that weaken with water depth. The overall classification indicators OA, AA, and Kappa reached 0.993, 0.973, and 0.987 respectively. The algorithm can effectively detect various signals with high detection accuracy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Watta uses photon heights estimated by the ICESat-2 ATL03 product and extracts supraglacial lake surface, bottom, and depth corrected for refraction and (sub-)surface ice cover in addition to producing surface heights at the native resolution of the ATL03 photon cloud. These measurements are used to constrain empirical estimates of lake depth from satellite imagery, which were thus far dependent on sparse sets of in situ measurements for calibration. Imagery sources include Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2, and high-resolution Planet Labs PlanetScope and SkySat data, used here for the first time to calculate supraglacial lake depths. The Watta algorithm was developed and tested using a set of 46 lakes near Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn) glacier in western Greenland, and we use multiple imagery sources (available for 45 of these lakes) to assess the use of the red vs. green band to extrapolate depths along a profile to full lake volumes. We use Watta-derived estimates in conjunction with high-resolution imagery from both satellite-based sources (tasked over the season) and nearly simultaneous Operation IceBridge CAMBOT (Continuous Airborne Mapping By Optical Translator) imagery (on a single airborne flight) for a focused study of the drainage of a single lake over the 2019 melt season. Our results suggest that the use of multiple imagery sources (both publicly available and commercial), in combination with altimetry-based depths, can move towards capturing the evolution of supraglacial hydrology at improved spatial and temporal scales.},

abstract = {Mapping bathymetric change is a core task for a wide range of navigation, research, monitoring, and design applications. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) can support this activity, particularly when using data from a platform, like the Sentinel-2A/B twin mission of the Copernicus programme, which provides routine and repetitive image acquisition at 10 m spatial resolution. As a result, SDB can expand on the temporal and spatial scope of more conventional mapping methods, such as lidar (or multi-beam). In this study, we use SDB, in comparison with high-resolution airborne lidar bathymetry (ALB), to quantify bathymetric changes at two inlets in North Carolina following the impacts of the devastating Hurricane Florence in September 2018. A recently developed multi-temporal SDB model that overcomes problems associated with turbidity and noise effects (whitecaps, ships, cloud shadows, etc.) is used with Sentinel-2 imagery. We identify bathymetric changes in shallow areas with navigation channels in two of the most dynamic inlets in the Outer Banks, Oregon and Hatteras. Multiple lidar surveys are used to validate the SDB method and for an assessment of accuracy and vertical uncertainty. The multi-temporal SDB products and ALB both show similar results in the erosion/accretion patterns. Comparing the change determined from the two methods, gives a median absolute error of {\~{}}0.5 m of SDB compared with ALB, with bias of ±0.2 m for depths ≤7 m; errors that are equivalent to those associated with the SDB estimated absolute depths. The composited SDB yields greater spatial coverage than lidar because it can retrieve data in areas where the lidar mission may have been constrained by turbidity or surf, and also because of the 300-km swath width. The Sentinel-2 constellation provides five-day revisit at the equator (more frequent at higher latitudes), allowing rapid construction of a bathymetric map as well as developing an archive for retrospective analysis. By implementing the multi-temporal turbidity correction, SDB based on Sentinel-2 may substantially enhance existing survey methods for change detection and support operational and recursive coastal monitoring on local to regional scales.},

Here we present the first global reanalysis of storm surges and extreme sea levels (GTSR data set) based on hydrodynamic modelling. GTSR covers the entire world's coastline and consists of time series of tides and surges, and estimates of extreme sea levels. Validation shows that there is good agreement between modelled and observed sea levels, and that the performance of GTSR is similar to that of many regional hydrodynamic models. Due to the limited resolution of the meteorological forcing, extremes are slightly underestimated. This particularly affects tropical cyclones, which requires further research. We foresee applications in assessing flood risk and impacts of climate change. As a first application of GTSR, we estimate that 1.3{\%} of the global population is exposed to a 1 in 100-year flood.},

abstract = {Mangrove migration, or transgression in response to global climatic changes or sea-level rise, is a slow process; to capture it, understanding both the present distribution of mangroves at individual patch (single-or clumped trees) scale, and their rates of change are essential. In this study, a new method was developed to delineate individual patches and to estimate mangrove cover from very high-resolution (0.08 m spatial resolution) true color (Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B) spectral channels) aerial photography. The method utilizes marker-based watershed segmentation, where markers are detected using a vegetation index and Otsu's automatic thresholding. Fourteen commonly used vegetation indices were tested, and shadows were removed from the segmented images to determine their effect on the accuracy of tree detection, cover estimation, and patch delineation. According to point-based accuracy analysis, we obtained adjusted overall accuracies {\textgreater}90{\%} in tree detection using seven vegetation indices. Likewise, using an object-based approach, the highest overlap accuracy between predicted and reference data was 95{\%}. The vegetation index Excess Green (ExG) without shadow removal produced the most accurate mangrove maps by separating tree patches from shadows and background marsh vegetation and detecting more individual trees. The method provides high precision delineation of mangrove trees and patches, and the opportunity to analyze mangrove migration patterns at the scale of isolated individuals and patches.},

Remote sensing made it possible to compare pre- and post-Tsunami images of large areas. A study site was selected based on medium resolution Landsat imagery and existing topographic maps. Selection criteria included substantial damages reported, presence of woody vegetated and non-vegetated shorelines, homogeneous bathymetry and good coverage of pre- and post-Tsunami satellite imagery. The Pichawaram mangrove, Tamil Nadu, India, matched these criteria. Pre- and post-Tsunami Ikonos and QuickBird images were compared through the visual interpretation of pre-Tsunami coastal vegetation and post-Tsunami damage. The results were validated in the field. The analysis showed that mangrove forests and coastal shelterbelts provided protection from the Tsunami. This was concluded from analysing the spatial distribution of damage relative to woody vegetation along the coast as well as transects detailing the amount of damage behind the coastline and the coastal woody vegetation.},

Our study highlights that precipitation, temperature and cyclone frequency explain 74{\%} of the global trends in maximum canopy height, with other geophysical factors influencing the observed variability at local and regional scales. We find the tallest mangrove forests in Gabon, equatorial Africa, where stands attain 62.8 m.

abstract = {Low-lying tropical islands are highly vulnerable to the effects of sea-level rise and climate change. Most pressing is the threat posed to their fresh water supplies by wave-induced flooding. This thesis attempts to generalize previous site-specific studies of flooding on coral atolls and apply it in a framework that can be used for early warning systems or long-term climate change impact studies. To do so, a large synthetic database of representative reef properties and hydrodynamics was developed using the numerical wave model XBeach, and then analyzed using a Bayesian probabilistic network. The resulting tool allows us to make real-time flood predictions based on offshore wave or sea level conditions, and the unique characteristics of a given island (e.g. topography). Narrow, smooth reefs with steep fore reef slopes are the most vulnerable to runup. Extreme flooding is associated with anomalously high, resonant low frequency waves, which are more likely to occur on narrow, smooth reefs subjected to extreme swell waves (large wave heights with long periods). These extreme swells are "blue sky" events which originate from distant storms. Thus, they may thus arrive without warning, since they are completely independent of local weather conditions. This bolsters the need for more effective prediction tools. Validation of the results presented in this study is limited by the small number of field observations against which the model can be compared. Thus, there is a need to develop a comprehensive database of reef morphology and hydrodynamics. Offshore wave conditions, water levels, and reef width are the most essential variables for predicting runup, so future research efforts should be directed towards collecting those data. This model can also be used to ask questions like, "which islands will be most severely impacted by climate change?", or "can we increase flood resilience for a given island by restoring its coral reefs?". Hence, there is also potential for its use in guiding decision-makers to allocate limited funding in the places where it will have the most impact.},

An inversion scenario is considered in which inversion is carried out separately for each 17-min-averaged set of observations. Results are used to quantify the inversion scheme's accuracy depending on time dependent wave and bathymetry conditions. The model generally produced a root-mean-square error of 0.46 m between modelled and actual bathymetry when both wave height observations and alongshore current observations were assimilated. The RMS error reduced to 0.44 m when only wave height observations were assimilated and increased to 0.69 m when only alongshore current observations were assimilated, suggesting that wave height is a more informative variable for bathymetry inversion. The model performed consistently in inverting bathymetry and thereby tracking morphologic change in varied wave conditions, including during large storm events.},

However, the current anthropogenic global warming above pre-industrial levels is inducing the degradation of seascape health with adverse impacts on biodiversity, economy, and societies. Bathymetric knowledge empowers our scientific, financial, and ecological understanding of the associated benefits, processes, and pressures to the coastal seascape. Here we leverage two commercial high-resolution multispectral satellite images of the Pleiades and two multibeam survey datasets to measure bathymetry in two zones (0-10 m and 10-30 m) in the tropical Anguilla and British Virgin Islands, northeast Caribbean. A methodological framework featuring a combination of an empirical linear transformation, cloud masking, sun-glint correction, and pseudo-invariant features allows spatially independent calibration and test of our satellite-derived bathymetry approach. The best R2 and RMSE for training and validation vary between 0.44-0.56 and 1.39-1.76 m, respectively, while minimum vertical errors are less than 1 m in the depth ranges of 7.8-10 and 11.6-18.4 m for the two explored zones. Given available field data, the present methodology could provide simple, time-efficient, and accurate spatio-temporal satellite-derived bathymetry intelligence in scientific and commercial tasks i.e., navigation, coastal habitat mapping and resource management, and reducing natural hazards.},

abstract = {Many terrestrial glaciers are sensitive indicators of past and present climate change as atmospheric temperature and snowfall modulate glacier volume. However, climate interpretations based on glacier behavior require careful selection of representative glaciers, as was recently pointed out for surging and debris-covered glaciers, whose behavior often defies regional glacier response to climate [Yde and Paasche, 2010]. Tidewater calving glaciers (TWGs)mountain glaciers whose termini reach the sea and are generally grounded on the seaflooralso fall into the category of non-representative glaciers because the regional-scale asynchronous behavior of these glaciers clouds their complex relationship with climate. TWGs span the globe; they can be found both fringing ice sheets and in high-latitude regions of each hemisphere. TWGs are known to exhibit cyclic behavior, characterized by slow advance and rapid, unstable retreat, largely independent of short-term climate forcing. This so-called TWG cycle, first described by Post [1975], provides a solid foundation upon which modern investigations of TWG stability are built. Scientific understanding has developed rapidly as a result of the initial recognition of their asynchronous cyclicity, rendering greater insight into the hierarchy of processes controlling regional behavior. This has improved the descriptions of the strong dynamic feedbacks present during retreat, the role of the ocean in TWG dynamics, and the similarities and differences between TWG and ice sheet outlet glaciers that can often support floating tongues.},

Investing in flood adaptation strategies may reduce the loss of life and livelihood caused by floods3. Where and how floods occur and who is exposed are changing as a result of rapid urbanization4, flood mitigation infrastructure5 and increasing settlements in floodplains6. Previous estimates of the global flood-exposed population have been limited by a lack of observational data, relying instead on models, which have high uncertainty3,7–11. Here we use daily satellite imagery at 250-metre resolution to estimate flood extent and population exposure for 913 large flood events from 2000 to 2018. We determine a total inundation area of 2.23 million square kilometres, with 255–290 million people directly affected by floods. We estimate that the total population in locations with satellite-observed inundation grew by 58–86 million from 2000 to 2015. This represents an increase of 20 to 24 per cent in the proportion of the global population exposed to floods, ten times higher than previous estimates7. Climate change projections for 2030 indicate that the proportion of the population exposed to floods will increase further. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the satellite observations will improve our understanding of where floods are changing and how best to adapt. The global flood database generated from these observations will help to improve vulnerability assessments, the accuracy of global and local flood models, the efficacy of adaptation interventions and our understanding of the interactions between landcover change, climate and floods.},

abstract = {Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has significant potential to enhance our knowledge of Earth's coastal regions. However, SDB still has limitations when applied to the turbid, but optically shallow, nearshore regions that encompass large areas of the world's coastal zone. Turbid water produces false shoaling in the imagery, constraining SDB for its routine application. This paper provides a framework that enables us to derive valid SDB over moderately turbid environments by using the high revisit time (5-day) of the Sentinel-2A/B twin mission from the Copernicus programme. The proposed methodology incorporates a robust atmospheric correction, a multi-scene compositing method to reduce the impact of turbidity, and a switching model to improve mapping in shallow water. Two study sites in United States are explored due to their varying water transparency conditions. Our results show that the approach yields accurate SDB, with median errors of under 0.5 m for depths 0–13 m when validated with lidar surveys, errors that favorably compare to uses of SDB in clear water. The approach allows for the semi-automated creation of bathymetric maps at 10 m spatial resolution, with manual intervention potentially limited only to the calibration to the absolute SDB. It also returns turbidity data to indicate areas that may still have residual shoaling bias. Because minimal in-situ information is required, this computationally-efficient technique has the potential for automated implementation, allowing rapid and repeated application in more environments than most existing methods, thereby helping with a range of issues in coastal research, management, and navigation.},

The available global mangrove databases, compiled using disparate geospatial data sources and national statistics, need to be improved. Here, we mapped the status and distributions of global mangroves using recently available Global Land Survey (GLS) data and the Landsat archive.Methods We interpreted approximately 1000 Landsat scenes using hybrid supervised and unsupervised digital image classification techniques. Each image was normalized for variation in solar angle and earth-sun distance by converting the digital number values to the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance. Ground truth data and existing maps and databases were used to select training samples and also for iterative labelling. Results were validated using existing GIS data and the published literature to map 'true mangroves'.Results The total area of mangroves in the year 2000 was 137,760 km2 in 118 countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Approximately 75{\%} of world's mangroves are found in just 15 countries, and only 6.9{\%} are protected under the existing protected areas network (IUCN I-IV). Our study confirms earlier findings that the biogeographic distribution of mangroves is generally confined to the tropical and subtropical regions and the largest percentage of mangroves is found between 5° N and 5° S latitude.Main conclusions We report that the remaining area of mangrove forest in the world is less than previously thought. Our estimate is 12.3{\%} smaller than the most recent estimate by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. We present the most comprehensive, globally consistent and highest resolution (30 m) global mangrove database ever created.

abstract = {Deltas are inherently low-lying structures and thus subject to large threats due to sea level rise, erosion and other coastal processes. The shorelines in many deltas around the world are now retreating and most cases appear to result from a decreasing sediment supply as a consequence of upstream dam construction. We present here results of an investigation of riverine sediment fluxes, coastal retreat, and coastal sediment accumulation in the Chao Phraya River and Delta (Thailand). This deltaic shoreline has one of the highest rates of shoreline retreat in the world. Surprisingly, our results show that in spite of the construction of two large storage dams, one on the Ping River (Bhumibol Dam, 1964) and the other on the Nan River (Sirikit Dam, 1972) that merge to form the Chao Phraya, sediment accumulation in the delta was actually higher over the last several decades than prior to dam construction. The recent higher rates of sediment accumulation, based on 210Pb dating, appear to be the result of increased sediment supply in the lower reaches of the river relating to expansion of aquaculture and other activities in the delta beginning in the 1970s. We also show that mangrove removal, in order to further develop shrimp farming, charcoal production, and other pursuits, was not responsible for most of the shoreline erosion. Rather, subsidence, mainly induced by groundwater withdrawal, together with worldwide sea level rise appears to be the main factor affecting the very rapid shoreline retreat of the Chao Phraya Delta.},

abstract = {With the advancement of Lidar technology, bottom depth ( H ) of optically shallow waters (OSW) can be measured accurately with an airborne or space-borne Lidar system ( H Lidar hereafter), but this data product consists of a line format, rather than the desired charts or maps, particularly when the Lidar system is on a satellite. Meanwhile, radiometric measurements from multiband imagers can also be used to infer H ( H imager hereafter) of OSW with variable accuracy, though a map of bottom depth can be obtained. It is logical and advantageous to use the two data sources from collocated measurements to generate a more accurate bathymetry map of OSW, where usually image-specific empirical algorithms are developed and applied. Here, after an overview of both the empirical and semianalytical algorithms for the estimation of H from multiband imagers, we emphasize that the uncertainty of H imager varies spatially, although it is straightforward to draw regressions between H Lidar and radiometric data for the generation of H imager . Further, we present a prototype system to map the confidence of H imager pixel-wise, which has been lacking until today in the practices of passive remote sensing of bathymetry. We advocate the generation of a confidence measure in parallel with H imager , which is important and urgent for broad user communities.},

abstract = {Accurate methods to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) of mangroves are required to monitor the subtle changes over time and assess their carbon sequestration. The AGB of forests is a function of canopy-related information (canopy density, vegetation status), structures, and tree heights. However, few studies have attended to integrating these factors to build models of the AGB of mangrove plantations. The objective of this study was to develop an accurate and robust biomass estimation of mangrove plantations using Chinese satellite optical, SAR, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data based digital surface models (DSM). This paper chose Qi'ao Island, which forms the largest contiguous area of mangrove plantation in China, as the study area. Several field visits collected 127 AGB samples. The models for AGB estimation were developed using the random forest algorithm and integrating images from multiple sources: optical images from Gaofen-2 (GF-2), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from Gaofen-3 (GF-3), and UAV-based digital surface model (DSM) data. The performance of the models was assessed using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and relative RMSE (RMSEr), based on five-fold cross-validation and stratified random sampling approach. The results showed that images from the GF-2 optical (RMSE = 33.49 t/ha, RMSEr = 21.55{\%}) or GF-3 SAR (RMSE = 35.32 t/ha, RMSEr = 22.72{\%}) can be used appropriately to monitor the AGB of the mangrove plantation. The AGB models derived from a combination of the GF-2 and GF-3 datasets yielded a higher accuracy (RMSE = 29.89 t/ha, RMSEr = 19.23{\%}) than models that used only one of them. The model that used both datasets showed a reduction of 2.32{\%} and 3.49{\%} in RMSEr over the GF-2 and GF-3 models, respectively. On the DSM dataset, the proposed model yielded the highest accuracy of AGB (RMSE = 25.69 t/ha, RMSEr = 16.53{\%}). The DSM data were identified as the most important variable, due to mitigating the saturation effect observed in the optical and SAR images for a dense AGB estimation of the mangroves. The resulting map, derived from the most accurate model, was consistent with the results of field investigations and the mangrove plantation sequences. Our results indicated that the AGB can be accurately measured by integrating images from the optical, SAR, and DSM datasets to adequately represent canopy-related information, forest structures, and tree heights.},

abstract = {Given a collection of N geo-located point samples of k types, we aim to detect spatial mixture patterns of interest, which are sub-regions of the study area that have significantly high or low mixture of points of different types. Spatial mixture patterns have important applications in many societal domains, including resilience of smart cities and communities, biodiversity, equity, business intelligence, etc. The problem is challenging because ranking and selection of candidate patterns can be highly susceptible to the effect of natural randomness, and real-world data often consists of various mixture patterns. In related work, the multi-nomial scan statistic does not support identification of high or low mixture due to its "directionless"nature and high sensitivity to the composition of mixture patterns in data. While species richness indices in biodiversity research allow specification of directions, the measures are very sensitive to spatial randomness effects. To bridge the gap, we first propose a spatial mixture index to provide robust ranking among candidate patterns. Then, we present a dual-level Monte-Carlo estimation method with a baseline algorithm for spatial mixture pattern detection. Finally, we propose both an exact algorithm and a distribution-inspired sequence-reduction heuristic to accelerate the baseline approach. Experiment results with both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed approaches can detect mixture patterns with high accuracy, and the acceleration methods can greatly reduce computational cost while maintaining high solution quality.},

abstract = {For effective mangrove forest mapping, it is valuable to develop vegetation indices from remote-sensing imagery that can characterize the unique characteristics of mangrove forests and differentiate them from other land cover types (especially other vegetation types). In addition to diverse range of vegetation indices derived from single-phase, remote-sensing imagery that has been applied to mangrove forest classifications, recently a submerged mangrove recognition index (SMRI for short) that considers multi-tidal, high-resolution, remote-sensing imagery, and which is based on the differential spectral signature of mangrove forests under high and low tides, was proposed for use in mangrove forest classifications (Xia et al., 2018). However, to date SMRI has not been compared with existing vegetation indices that are often applied in mangrove forest classifications based on remote-sensing imagery in detail. In this study, the SMRI values obtained from medium- and high-resolution images (i.e., Landsat 8 OIL/TIRS and GF-1 respectively) are compared with four vegetation indices widely used in mangrove forest classifications (i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index, ratio vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and soil adjusted vegetation index). One more vegetation index, which was only available for remote-sensing imagery with visible bands, a short-wave infrared band, and a mid-wave infrared band, i.e., Landsat 8 OIL/TIRS images, was also compared with the SMRI obtained from the medium-resolution images. The results from experiments with medium- and high-resolution images of Yulin City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China show that the SMRI can distinguish submerged mangrove forests more effectively than the compared vegetation indices, especially in areas between high- and low-tide levels. Furthermore, the SMRI results obtained from high-resolution images perform better than those obtained from medium-resolution images.},

abstract = {Tis paper integrates information on climate change, hydrodynamic models, and geographic overlays to assess the vulnerability of coastal areas in Bangladesh to larger storm surges and sea-level rise by 2050. Te approach identifies polders (diked areas), coastal populations, settlements, infrastructure, and economic activity at risk of inundation, and estimates the cost of damage versus the cost of several adaptation measures. A 27-centimeter sea-level rise and 10 percent intensification of wind speed from global warming suggests the vulnerable zone increases in size by 69 percent given a +3-meter inundation depth and by 14 percent given a +1-meter inundation depth. At present, Bangladesh has 123 polders, an early warning and evacuation system, and more than 2,400 emergency shelters to protect coastal inhabitants from tidal waves and storm surges. However, in a changing climate, it is estimated that 59 of the 123 polders would be overtopped during storm surges and another 5,500 cyclone shelters (each with the capacity of 1,600 people) to safeguard the population would be needed. Investments including strengthening polders, foreshore afforestation, additional multi-purpose cyclone shelters, cyclone-resistant private housing, and further strengthening of the early warning and evacuation system would cost more than {\$}2.4 billion with an annual recurrent cost of more than {\$}50 million. However, a conservative damage estimate suggests that the incremental cost of adapting to these climate change related risks by 2050 is small compared with the potential damage in the absence of adaptation measures.},

However, the systematic and continuous identification of vegetation cover, whether on a global or regional scale, demands large storage and processing capacities. This manuscript presents a Google Earth Engine (GEE)-managed pipeline to compute the annual status of Brazilian mangroves from 1985 to 2018, along with a new spectral index, the Modular Mangrove Recognition Index (MMRI), which has been specifically designed to better discriminate mangrove forests from the surrounding vegetation. If compared separately, the periods from 1985 to 1998 and 1999 to 2018 show distinct mangrove area trends. The first period, from 1985 to 1998, shows an upward trend, which seems to be related more to the uneven distribution of Landsat data than to a regeneration of Brazilian mangroves. In the second period, from 1999 to 2018, a trend of mangrove area loss was registered, reaching up to 2{\%} of the mangrove forest.

With this, we present the Google Earth Engine (GEE) based approach for long term mapping of mangrove forests and their surroundings. In this study, we used a GEE based approach: 1) to create atmospheric contamination free data from 1987-2017 from different Landsat satellite imagery; and 2) evaluating the random forest classifier and post classification change detection method. The obtained overall accuracy for the years 1987 and 2017 was determined to be 0.87 and 0.96, followed by a Kappa coefficient 0.80 and 0.94. The change detection results revealed a significant decrease in the agricultural area, while there was an increase in mangrove forest, shrimp/fish farm, and bareland area.

abstract = {The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) aboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) has been making very high resolution measurements of the Earth's surface elevation since October 2018. ATLAS uses photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as detectors in photon counting mode, so that a single photon reflected back to the receiver triggers a detection within the ICESat-2 data acquisition system. However, one characteristic of ICESat-2 detected photons is the possible presence of afterpulses, defined as small amplitude pulses occurring after the primary signal pulse due to photon arrival. The disadvantage of these afterpulses is that they often confound the accurate measurements of low level signals following a large amplitude of signal and can degrade energy resolution and cause errors in pulse counting applications. This paper discusses and summarizes the after-pulsing effects exhibited by the ATLAS PMTs based on on-orbit measurements over different seasons and geographic regions. The potential impacts of these after-pulsing effects on altimetry and ocean subsurface retrievals are discussed.},

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) on the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) mission is a six beam, low energy, high repetition rate, 532-nm laser transmitter with photon counting detectors. Although designed primarily for detecting height changes in ice caps, sea ice, and vegetation, the polar-orbiting satellite will observe global surface water during its designed three-year life span, including inland water bodies, coasts, and open oceans. In preparation for the mission, an ICESat-2 prototype, the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL), was built and flown on high-altitude aircraft experiments over a range of inland and near-shore targets. The purpose was to test the ATLAS concept and to provide a database for developing an algorithm that detects along track surface water height and light penetration under a range of atmospheric and water conditions. The current analysis examines the datasets of three MABEL transects observed from 20 km above ground of coastal and inland waters conducted in 2012 and 2013. Transects ranged from about 2 to 12 km in length and included the middle Chesapeake Bay, the near-shore Atlantic coast at Virginia Beach, and Lake Mead. Results indicate MABEL's high capability for retrieving surface water height statistics with a mean height precision of approximately 5–7 cm per 100-m segment length. Profiles of attenuated subsurface backscatter, characterized using a Signal to Background Ratio written in Log10 base, or LSBR0, were observed over a range of 1.3 to 9.3 m, depending on water clarity and atmospheric background. Results indicate that observable penetration depth, although primarily dependent on water properties, was greatest when the solar background rate was low. Near-shore bottom reflectance was detected only at the Lake Mead site down to a maximum of 10 m under a clear night sky and low turbidity of approximately 1.6 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). The overall results suggest that the feasibility of retrieving operational surface water height statistics from space-based photon counting systems such as ATLAS is very high for resolutions down to about 100 m, even in partly cloudy conditions. The capability to observe subsurface backscatter profiles is achievable but requires much longer transects of several hundreds of meters.},

If climate change and subsidence are also considered, current protection will need to be upgraded to avoid unacceptable losses. Flood exposure is increasing in coastal cities1,2 owing to growing populations and assets, the changing climate3, and subsidence4,5,6. Here we provide a quantification of present and future flood losses in the 136 largest coastal cities. Using a new database of urban protection and different assumptions on adaptation, we account for existing and future flood defences. Average global flood losses in 2005 are estimated to be approximately US{\$}6 billion per year, increasing to US{\$}52 billion by 2050 with projected socio-economic change alone. With climate change and subsidence, present protection will need to be upgraded to avoid unacceptable losses of US{\$}1 trillion or more per year. Even if adaptation investments maintain constant flood probability, subsidence and sea-level rise will increase global flood losses to US{\$}60–63 billion per year in 2050. To maintain present flood risk, adaptation will need to reduce flood probabilities below present values. In this case, the magnitude of losses when floods do occur would increase, often by more than 50{\%}, making it critical to also prepare for larger disasters than we experience today. The analysis identifies the cities that seem most vulnerable to these trends, that is, where the largest increase in losses can be expected.},

Currently, the area of non-cultivable land between cultivated land parcels is usually measured by artificial visual interpretation or by fieldwork. This study focused on the extraction of uncultivable trails, ditches, and cultivated field parcels within farmland on the basis of a Light Detection and Ranging-derived (LiDAR-derived) high-resolution gridded Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The proposed approach was applied to generate polygons of individual land parcels in a flood storage and detention area. The DEM was first smoothed and then subtracted. To remove small spots and to smooth the boundaries of the land parcels, inner and outer buffers were created to generalize the extracted polygons. Experiments proved that this approach is applicable in flood plain farmland and demonstrated that the chosen parameters were appropriate. This approach is more efficient than traditional surveying methods. For field parcel extraction, the accuracy achieved was 93.42{\%}, using official statistics for comparison, and the Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.90, using a visual interpretation of an aerial image for comparison. The kappa coefficients were 0.87 and 0.77 for trail and ditch extraction, respectively.},

Here we present S2Shores (Satellite to Shores), the first sub-kilometer global atlas of coastal bathymetry based on depth inversion from wave kinematics captured by the Sentinel-2 constellation. The methodology reveals coastal seafloors up to a hundred meters in depth which allows covering most continental shelves and represents 4.9 million km2 along the world coastline. Although the vertical accuracy (RMSE 6–9 m) is currently coarser than that of traditional surveying techniques, S2Shores is of particular interest to countries that do not have the means to carry out in situ surveys and to unexplored regions such as polar areas. S2Shores is a major step forward in mitigating the effects of global changes on coastal communities and ecosystems by providing scientists, engineers, and policy makers with new science-based decision tools.},

Unfortunately, efforts to assess progress, as well as to strategically plan and prioritize new marine conservation measures, have been hampered by the lack of a detailed, comprehensive biogeographic system to classify the oceans. Here we report on a new global system for coastal and shelf areas: the Marine Ecoregions of the World, or MEOW, a nested system of 12 realms, 62 provinces, and 232 ecoregions. This system provides considerably better spatial resolution than earlier global systems, yet it preserves many common elements and can be cross-referenced to many regional biogeographic classifications. The designation of terrestrial ecoregions has revolutionized priority setting and planning for terrestrial conservation; we anticipate similar benefits from the use of a coherent and credible marine system.},

abstract = {Rapid and accurate ecological surveys of mangroves are of great significance for coastal protection and global carbon balance assessments. Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2)/Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) data provide an opportunity to conduct large-scale surveys of mangroves. The purpose of this study was to assess the expressiveness of ICESat-2 data for ground and canopy height retrievals in mangroves. First, the ICESat-2 data were processed to obtain the ground and canopy heights of mangrove areas. Second, the accuracies of the ground and canopy heights retrieved from the ICESat-2 data were verified by airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Finally, we analyzed the influence of various factors on the ground and canopy height estimation accuracies. The results showed that the average errors of ICESat-2 for the ground and canopy heights were 0.28 and -0.21 m and that the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) were 0.96 and 2.50 m. The accuracies of the ICESat-2 ground and canopy height estimates differed significantly when day/night and strong/weak beams were used. The strong beams at night provided the most accurate estimations of canopy height (RMSE{\%} = 24.4{\%}) and are thus the most suitable choice for studying mangrove areas. In addition, the results indicated that slope is the variable that has the greatest influence on the accuracy of the ground elevation estimates of the four factors above, while the accuracy of canopy height estimates is significantly affected by the canopy height itself. Overall, our study found that ICESat-2 data are suitable for ecological investigations of mangroves.},

abstract = {Extreme weather events are a cause of mangrove forest loss and degradation globally. Almost half of the world's mangroves are found in the tropical cyclone belt, and forests often experience disturbance in structure, functioning and ecosystem service provision. Understanding the factors that increase the vulnerability of mangroves to such disturbances is a challenge. Using a novel remote sensing analysis combining water class change with vegetation classification, we showed that mangrove loss across multiple cyclone events is influenced by previous erosion history, suggesting that the prior state of the coastline affects susceptibility to future disturbance events. During Cyclone Amphan in May 2020, more than 1,200 km2 of mangroves were damaged and 40.6 km2 of shoreline was lost. Cyclone Amphan caused the most damage out of three recent cyclones, with the most mangrove loss (18.8{\%}) experienced along shorelines that were eroding over the past 35 years. This can be explained by the long-term effect of erosion on the overall intertidal morphology of the shoreline. Landscape-scale mangrove management, particularly of sediment budgets is essential to switch previously eroding mangroves to a state where they can withstand cumulative storm impacts.},

abstract = {It has been widely recognized that ongoing climate change, most likely due to human interference with nature, may accelerate sea level rise and increase storm intensity. It is therefore urgent to design countermeasures to alleviate the im- pact of climate change on coastal regions. Apart from the view point of coastal protection, it is also very important for coastal engineers to keep an eye on en- vironmental issues in the coastal region. In this context, vegetation fields such as salt marshes, sea grasses and mangrove forests in coastal regions have started to attract the attention of coastal engineers due to their function as wave atten- uator. However, the wave attenuation function of a vegetated field is not well understood yet. To utilize coastal vegetation fields as a part of coastal manage- ment in practice, it is crucial to accumulate more knowledge about the physical processes, especially the hydraulic processes, and these need to be modeled in a practical sense. Hence, this thesis is intended as an investigation of the process of wave dissipation over vegetation fields through various approaches, specifically theoretical, physical and numerical studies.

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

This was extended by Mendez and Losada (2004) to include varying depths and the effects of wave damping due to vegetation and wave breaking for narrow-banded random waves. This paper describes the wave dissipation over a vegetation field by the implementation of the Mendez and Losada formulation in a full spectrum model SWAN, with an extension to include a vertical layer schematization for the vegetation. The present model is validated with the original equation and results from Mendez and Losada (2004). The sensitivity of the model to the shape of the frequency spectrum, directional spreading and layer schematization are investigated. The model is then applied to field measurements by using a vegetation factor. This model has the ability to calculate two-dimensional wave dissipation over a vegetation field including some important aspects such as breaking and diffraction as used in SWAN model. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In October of 2004, a 3-d observational program to measure flow and sediment resuspension within a coastal intertidal salt marsh was conducted in the North Inlet/Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve located near Georgetown, South Carolina. Current and acoustic backscatter profiles were obtained from a moored acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) deployed in a shallow tidal channel during the spring phase of the tidal cycle under high discharge conditions. The channel serves as a conduit between Winyah Bay, a large brackish estuary, and North Inlet, a saline intertidal coastal salt marsh with little freshwater input. Salinity measurements indicate that the water column is vertically well mixed during flood, but becomes vertically stratified during early ebb. The stratification results from brackish (15 psu) Winyah Bay water entering North Inlet via the tidal channel, suggesting an exchange mechanism that permits North Inlet to receive a fraction of the poor water quality and high discharge flow from upland rivers. Although maximum flood currents exceed maximum ebb currents by 0.2 m s-1, suspended sediment concentrations are highest during the latter ebb phase and persist for a longer fraction of the ebb cycle. Even though the channel is flood-dominated, the higher concentrations occurring over a longer fraction of the ebb phase indicate net particulate transport from Winyah Bay to North Inlet during spring tide accompanied by high discharge. Our evidence suggests that the higher concentrations during ebb result from increased bed friction caused by flow asymmetries and variations in water depth in which the highest stresses occur near the end of ebb near low water despite stronger maximum currents during flood. {\textcopyright} 2007 Estuarine Research Federation.},

abstract = {Exposure to coastal flooding is increasing due to growing population and economic activity. These developments go hand-in-hand with a loss and deterioration of ecosystems. Ironically, these ecosystems can play a buffering role in reducing flood hazard. The ability of ecosystems to contribute to reducing coastal flooding has been emphasized in multiple studies. However, the role of ecosystems in hybrid coastal protection (i.e. a combination of ecosystems and levees) has been poorly quantified at a global scale. Here, we evaluate the use of coastal vegetation, mangroves, and marshes fronting levees to reduce global coastal protection costs, by accounting for wave-vegetation interaction.The research is carried out by combining earth observation data and hydrodynamic modelling. We show that incooperating vegetation in hybrid coastal protection results in more sustainable and financially attractive coastal protection strategies. If vegetated foreshore levee systems were established along populated coastlines susceptible to flooding, the required levee crest height could be considerably reduced. This would result in a reduction of 320 (range: 107-961) billion USD2005 Power Purchasing Parity (PPP) in investments, of which 67.5 (range: 22.5- 202) billion USD2005 PPP in urban areas for a 1 in 100-year flood protection level.},

Even for coral reefs, marshes, and mangroves, important ecological services have yet to be valued reliably, such as cross-ecosystem nutrient transfer (coral reefs), erosion control (marshes), and pollution control (mangroves). An important issue for valuing certain ECE services, such as coastal protection and habitat–fishery linkages, is that the ecological functions underlying these services vary spatially and temporally. Allowing for the connectivity between ECE habitats also may have important implications for assessing the ecological functions underlying key ecosystems services, such coastal protection, control of erosion, and habitat–fishery linkages. Finally, we conclude by suggesting an action plan for protecting and/or enhancing the immediate and longer-term values of ECE services. Because the connectivity of ECEs across land–sea gradients also influences the provision of certain ecosystem services, management of the entire seascape will be necessary to preserve such synergistic effects. Other key elements of an action plan include further ecological and economic collaborative research on valuing ECE services, improving institutional and legal frameworks for management, controlling and regulating destructive economic activities, and developing ecological restoration options.},

abstract = {Ecosystem services offered by mangrove forests are facing severe risks, particularly through land use change driven by human development. Remote sensing has become a primary instrument to monitor the land use dynamics surrounding mangrove ecosystems. Where studies formerly relied on bi-temporal assessments of change, the practical limitations concerning data-availability and processing power are slowly disappearing with the onset of high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud-computing services, such as in the Google Earth Engine (GEE). This paper combines the capabilities of GEE, including its entire Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 archives and state-of-the-art classification approaches, with a post-classification temporal analysis to optimize land use classification results into gap-free and consistent information. The results demonstrate its application and value to uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics of mangrove forests and land use changes in Ngoc Hien District, Ca Mau province, Vietnamese Mekong delta. The combination of repeated GEE classification output and post-classification optimization provides valid spatial classification (94–96{\%} accuracy) and temporal interpolation (87–92{\%} accuracy). The findings reveal that the net change of mangroves forests over the 2001–2019 period equals −0.01{\%} annually. The annual gap-free maps enable spatial identification of hotspots of mangrove forest changes, including deforestation and degradation. Post-classification temporal optimization allows for an exploitation of temporal patterns to synthesize and enhance independent classifications towards more robust gap-free spatial maps that are temporally consistent with logical land use transitions. The study contributes to a growing body of work advocating full exploitation of temporal information in optimizing land cover classification and demonstrates its use for mangrove forest monitoring.},

Remote sensing satellites have the advantage in such fields because they are capable of global observation and repeatedly. Several satellite-based digital elevation datasets were provided to examine global terrains with medium resolutions e.g. the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), the global digital elevation model by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER GDEM). A new global digital surface model (DSM) dataset using the archived data of the Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS, nicknamed “Daichi”) has been completed on March 2016 by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) collaborating with NTT DATA Corp. and Remote Sensing Technology Center, Japan. This project is called “ALOS World 3D” (AW3D), and its dataset consists of the global DSM dataset with 0.15 arcsec. pixel spacing (approx. 5{\&}thinsp;m mesh) and ortho-rectified PRISM image with 2.5{\&}thinsp;m resolution. JAXA is also processing the global DSM with 1{\&}thinsp;arcsec. spacing (approx. 30{\&}thinsp;m mesh) based on the AW3D DSM dataset, and partially releasing it free of charge, which calls “ALOS World 3D 30{\&}thinsp;m mesh” (AW3D30). The global AW3D30 dataset will be released on May 2016. This paper describes the processing status, a preliminary validation result of the AW3D30 DSM dataset, and its public release status. As a summary of the preliminary validation of AW3D30 DSM, 4.40{\&}thinsp;m (RMSE) of the height accuracy of the dataset was confirmed using 5,121 independent check points distributed in the world.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Low-lying coastal zones are home to around 10{\%} of the world's population and to many megacities. Coastal zones are largely vulnerable to the dynamics of natural and human-induced changes. Accurate large-scale measurements of key parameters, such as bathymetry, are needed to understand and predict coastal changes. However, nearly 50{\%} of the world's coastal waters remain unsurveyed and for a large number of coastal areas of interest, bathymetric information is unavailable or is often decades old. This lack of information is due to the high costs in time, money and safety involved in collecting these data using conventional echo sounder on ships or LiDAR on aircrafts. Europe is no exception, as European seas are not adequately surveyed according to the International Hydrographic Organisation. Bathymetry influences ocean waves and currents, thereby shaping sediment transport which may alter coastal morphology over time. This paper discusses state-of-the-art coastal bathymetry retrieval methods and data, user requirements and key drivers for many maritime sectors in Europe, including advances in Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB). By leveraging satellite constellations, cloud services and by combining complementary methods, SDB appears as an effective emerging tool with the best compromise in time, coverage and investment to map coastal bathymetry and its temporal evolution.},

A simplified momentum equation, balancing vegetation drag and pressure gradient, is combined with the continuity equation resulting in a diffusion equation. Assuming a simplified environment, a one-dimensional analytical solution is obtained to predict peak surge level across a forest. The solution accurately reproduces peak water level of a 10-year return period flood event in mangroves in the Firth of Thames, New Zealand, and in Ten Thousand Islands, Florida, during Hurricane Charley. Vegetation properties that determine the capacity of mangroves to reduce surges are forest density and cross-shore extent. Storm characteristics—flood duration and peak water level at the forest fringe—also influence surge attenuation. Mangroves are shown to be an effective form of coastal flood protection if forests are sufficiently wide/dense, relative to the surge decay length scale, to restrict water exchange during a storm.},

abstract = {Single photon lidar (SPL) systems have great potential to be an effective tool for mapping due to their high data collection efficiency. However, the large number of false returns in SPL point clouds represents a huge challenge for the extraction of weak signal targets with low reflectivity or small cross sections. Numerous filtering methods have been proposed that attempt to effectively remove these noise points from the final point cloud model. However, weak signal points have similar characteristics to noise returns, and thus can be incorrectly eliminated as noise points during the filtering process. Herein, a novel voxel-spherical adaptive ellipsoid searching (VSAES) method is proposed, by which weak signal returns can be successfully retained while still removing a majority of the noise points. By employing this voxel-spherical (VS) model, our proposed method can simultaneously process a combined SPL dataset containing multiple flightlines, in which the noise density is unevenly distributed throughout the whole dataset. In addition, an improved adaptive ellipsoid searching (AES) method based on hypothesis testing is able to remove noise points more robustly than the originally described version. The experimental results show that the proposed method retains 89.1{\%} of the weak signal point returns from electric power lines, which is a significant improvement over the performance of either to the original AES method (25.9{\%}) or a histogram filtering based method (13.4{\%}).},

This study applied an integrated Markov Chain and Cellular Automata model to identify mangrove forest change in the interval years of 1989–2015 and predict it in 2028. Remote sensing technology is used based on Landsat satellite imagery (1989, 1998, 2002, and 2015). The results showed mangrove forest has decreased around 9.6{\%} from 1989 to 1998 due to forest fire, and has increased by 8.4{\%} between 1998 and 2002, and 2.3{\%} in 2002–2015. Other results show that mangroves area has continued to increase from 2015 to 2028 by 27.4{\%} to 31{\%} (7974.8 ha).

abstract = {This Short Communication provides a Coastal Engineering perspective on present and emerging capabilities of satellite optical imagery, including real-world applications that can now be realistically implemented from the desktop. Significantly, at the vast majority of locations worldwide, satellite remote sensing is currently the only source of information to complement much more limited in-situ instrumentation for land and sea mapping, monitoring and measurement. Less well recognised is that publicly available, routinely sampled and now easily accessible optical imagery covering virtually every position along the world's coastlines already spans multiple decades. In the past five years the common obstacles of (1) limited access to high-performance computing and (2) specialist remote sensing technical expertise, have been largely removed. The emergence of several internet-accessible application programming interfaces (APIs) now enable applied users to access petabytes of satellite imagery along with the necessary tools and processing power to extract, manipulate and analyse information of practical interest. Following a brief overview and timeline of civilian Earth observations from space, satellite-derived shorelines (SDS) and satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) are used to introduce and demonstrate some of the present real-world capabilities of satellite optical imagery most relevant to coastal professionals and researchers. These practical examples illustrate the use of satellite imagery to monitor and quantify both engineered and storm-induced coastline changes, as well as the emerging potential to obtain seamless topo/bathy surveys along coastal regions. Significantly, timescales of satellite-derived changes at the coast can range from decades to days, with spatial scales of interest extending from individual project sites up to unprecedented regional and global studies. While we foresee the uptake and routine use of satellite-derived information becoming quickly ubiquitous within the Coastal Engineering profession, on-ground observations are – and in our view will remain - fundamentally important. Compared to precision in-situ instrumentation, present intrinsic limitations of satellites are their relatively low rates of revisit and decimetre spatial accuracy. New satellite advances including ‘video from space' and the potential to combine Earth observation with numerical and data-driven coastal models through assimilation and artificial intelligence are advances that we foresee will have future major impact in Coastal Engineering.},

abstract = {This paper concerns the GlobColour-merged chlorophyll a products based on satellite observation (SeaWiFS, MERIS, MODIS, VIIRS and OLCI) and disseminated in the framework of the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS). This work highlights the main advantages provided by the Copernicus GlobColour processor which is used to serve CMEMS with a long time series from 1997 to present at the global level (4 km spatial resolution) and for the Atlantic level 4 product (1 km spatial resolution). To compute the merged chlorophyll a product, two major topics are discussed: - The first of these topics is the strategy for merging remote-sensing data, for which two options are considered. On the one hand, a merged chlorophyll a product computed from a prior merging of the remote-sensing reflectance of a set of sensors. On the other hand, a merged chlorophyll a product resulting from a combination of chlorophyll a products computed for each sensor. - The second topic is the flagging strategy used to discard non-significant observations (e.g. clouds, high glint and so on). These topics are illustrated by comparing the CMEMS GlobColour products provided by ACRI-ST (Garnesson et al., 2019) with the OC-CCI/C3S project (Sathyendranath et al., 2018). While GlobColour merges chlorophyll a products with a specific flagging, the OC-CCI approach is based on a prior reflectance merging before chlorophyll a derivation and uses a more constrained flagging approach.Although this work addresses these two topics, it does not pretend to provide a full comparison of the two data sets, which will require a better characterisation and additional intercomparison with in situ data.},

abstract = {{\textless}p class="MsoNormal"{\textgreater}Due to climate change and sea level risethe coastal zones are getting exposed to increasing risks like coastalrecession, putting in risk human lives and coastal infrastructure being worthbillions of dollars. Low lying countries like the Netherlands are consideredmore vulnerable to the effects of sea level rise. Large parts of the Dutchcoast have been eroding for centuries and nourishments schemes of approximately12 million m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} have been implemented annually in order to maintainthe coastline as it was in 1990. However, the future dune erosion will further increasedue to the impacts of climate change and hence the adaptation strategies shouldbe in line with the accelerated sea level rise and the possible effects thatmay bring. The most commonly used method to assess sealevel rise impacts on shorelines is the Bruun rule. However,Bruun rule's deterministic nature cannot align with the risk-based framework thatcoastal zone management requires nowadays. This necessity initiated thedevelopment of a process-based model, the Probabilistic Coastline Recession(PCR) model, estimating the future coastal recessions in a probabilisticapproach. In this research, the PCR framework wasapplied at eleven locations along the Holland coast, in the Netherlands, underthree different SLR scenarios, the RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and Deltascenario. The availabilityof coastal profile data (from 1965 until now) and coastline position data (from1843 till 1980) made the Holland coast an ideal location to explore and extendthe applicability of the PCR framework. The most relevant assumptions for thiscoast were identified and explored. The recovery rate of the dune was a weakpoint of the PCR model and Holland coast was an interesting area to be tested.Three approaches of calibrating the natural recovery rate of the dunes werefollowed. In addition, the alongshore sediment transport which was assumednegligible to the previous case studies, in this work it was integrated intothe PCR model and pointed out that its contribution is important to the PCR. For the eleven selected coastal profiles,20,000 simulations of 81 years (2020-2100) have been conducted and for everysimulation the most landward position of the coastline in every calendar yearhas been recorded. Hence, an empirical distribution of coastline recession forevery future year has been constructed. The ranges of the expected retreats in2100 (relative to 2020) for the different SLR scenarios are:0.5 m-155 m (for RCP4.5), 6 m-194 m (for RCP8.5) and18 m-172 m (for Deltascenario), corresponding to the 50 {\%}exceedance probability values of the cumulative distribution function of thecoastline retreat. The average values of the coastal retreat for 2100 are 61 m,73 m and 97 m for RCP4.5, RCP 8.5, and Deltascenario respectively.The relevant average erosion volume by 2100 are 1664 m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/m,2005 m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/m and 2665 m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/m. According to thefindings, in 2100 the relative increase in volume loss along the entire theHolland coast is expected to be 95 {\%}, 121 {\%} and 173 {\%}respectively for RCP4.5, 138 {\%} for RCP8.5 and 195 {\%} for Deltascenario.Finally, the results were compared to those raised from the Bruun rule method. Accordingto the findings, the majority of the profiles showing an erosive trend in thepast (before the ‘hold-the-line' policy) raised slightly more conservativeresults when implementing the PCR model rather than when applying the Bruunrule method- especially under the Deltascenario. On the other hand, theBruun rule method is more conservative than PCR model for most of the accretiveprofiles. The PCR model can now be explored tolocations where the longshore sediment transport is not negligible. Theapproach followed in this study allows investigating the ability of the modelfor future coastal retreat estimates when a construction of a hard defence structureor a port may change abruptly the longshore sediment transport. Last, this studyadvances the PCR framework and can be a valuable assistance in the course offurther improving the model. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Managing flood risk, i.e. both the hazard and the potential consequences, is an important aspect of adapting to global change and has gained much traction in recent decades. As a result, a priori flood risk assessments have become an important part of flood management practices. Many methodologies have been set up, ranging from global risk assessments for the world as a whole, to local assessments for a particular stretch of a river/coast or small town. Most assessment frameworks generally follow a similar approach, but there are also notable differences between assessments at different spatial scales. This review article examines these differences, for instance those related to the methodology, use of assessments and uncertainties. From this review, future research needs are identified in order to improve flood risk assessments at different scales. At global/continental scale, there is a clear need for harmonised information on flood defences to improve assessments. Furthermore, inclusions of indirect economic effects at the macro-/meso-scale would give a better indication of the total effects of catastrophic flooding. At the meso-/micro-scale, there is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the effects of flooding on critical infrastructures, given their importance to society, the economy, emergency management and reconstruction. An overarching theme at all scales is the validation of flood risk assessments, which is often limited. More detailed post-disaster information would allow for improved calibration, validation and thus performance of flood risk models. Lastly, the link between spatial scales also deserves attention, for instance up- or downscaling methodologies.},

abstract = {Mangroves protect coastal areas against hazards like storms or cyclones by attenuating waves and currents, and by trapping floating debris during extreme events. Bangladesh is a very vulnerable country to floods and cyclones, and part of its coastal system is thus being upgraded to a higher safety standard. These upgrades include embankment reinforcement and mangrove afforestation schemes seawards of the embankments. To further strengthen the implementation of combined green–grey infrastructure in future programs, identifying potential mangrove development sites near the polder systems is a necessary first step. We thus developed a tool to systematically identify mangrove sites throughout the coastal area based on open access data. This method identifies potential sites for mangrove development based on their distance from existing mangrove patches and suggests the required technique to implement the vegetation depending on the rate of coastline change. Our method showed that approximately 600 km of the coastal stretches placed seawards of embankments are within 10 km of existing mangroves, and could thus be potential sites for mangrove establishment. Out of those 600 km, we identified 140 km of coastline where the landwards polders are particularly vulnerable to flooding. The sites with highest restoration potential and priority are located in Galachipa, Hatiya, Bhola, Manpura, Khangona, and Boro Moheshkhali. More detailed data collection and local assessments are recommended prior to executing mangrove afforestation schemes. Nevertheless, this method could serve as a useful systematic tool for feasibility studies that identify mangrove opportunities in data-scarce areas and help to prioritize data collection at the sites of highest interest.},

abstract = {Airborne or space-borne photon-counting lidar can provide successive photon clouds of the Earth{\&}rsquo;s surface. The distribution and density of signal photons are very different because different land cover types have different surface profiles and reflectance, especially in coastal areas where the land cover types are various and complex. A new adaptive signal photon detection method is proposed to extract the signal photons for different land cover types from the raw photons captured by the MABEL (Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar) photon-counting lidar in coastal areas. First, the surface types with 30 m resolution are obtained via matching the geographic coordinates of the MABEL trajectory with the NLCD (National Land Cover Database) datasets. Second, in each along-track segment with a specific land cover type, an improved DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm with adaptive thresholds and a JONSWAP (Joint North Sea Wave Project) wave algorithm is proposed and integrated to detect signal photons on different surface types. The result in Pamlico Sound indicates that this new method can effectively detect signal photons and successfully eliminate noise photons below the water level, whereas the MABEL result failed to extract the signal photons in vegetation segments and failed to discard the after-pulsing noise photons. In the Atlantic Ocean and Pamlico Sound, the errors of the RMS (Root Mean Square) wave height between our result and in-situ result are {\&}minus;0.06 m and 0.00 m, respectively. However, between the MABEL and in-situ result, the errors are {\&}minus;0.44 m and {\&}minus;0.37 m, respectively. The mean vegetation height between the East Lake and Pamlico Sound was also calculated as 15.17 m using the detecting signal photons from our method, which agrees well with the results (15.56 m) from the GFCH (Global Forest Canopy Height) dataset. Overall, for different land cover types in coastal areas, our study indicates that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of the signal photon detection for photon-counting lidar data, and the detected signal photons can further obtain the water levels and vegetation heights. The proposed approach can also be extended for ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) datasets in the future.},

abstract = {We analyze errors in the global bathymetry models of Smith and Sandwell that combine satellite altimetry with acoustic soundings and shorelines to estimate depths. Versions of these models have been incorporated into Google Earth and the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO). We use Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) multibeam surveys not previously incorporated into the models as "ground truth" to compare against model versions 7.2 through 12.1, defining vertical differences as "errors." Overall error statistics improve over time: 50th percentile errors declined from 57 to 55 to 49 m, and 90th percentile errors declined from 257 to 235 to 219 m, in versions 8.2, 11.1 and 12.1. This improvement is partly due to an increasing number of soundings incorporated into successive models, and partly to improvements in the satellite gravity model. Inspection of specific sites reveals that changes in the algorithms used to interpolate across survey gaps with altimetry have affected some errors. Versions 9. 1 through 11.1 show a bias in the scaling from gravity in milliGals to topography in meters that affected the 15-160 km wavelength band. Regionally averaged ({\textgreater}160 km wavelength) depths have accumulated error over successive versions 9 through 11. These problems have been mitigated in version 12.1, which shows no systematic variation of errors with depth. Even so, version 12. 1 is in some respects not as good as version 8.2, which employed a different algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. (outside the USA).},

abstract = {We examine the issue of sustained measurements of sea level in the coastal zone, first by summarizing the long-term observations from tide gauges, then showing how those are now complemented by improved satellite altimetry products in the coastal ocean. We present some of the progresses in coastal altimetry, both from dedicated reprocessing of the radar waveforms and from the development of improved corrections for the atmospheric effects. This trend towards better altimetric data at the coast comes also from technological innovations such as Ka-band altimetry and SAR altimetry, and we discuss the advantages deriving from the AltiKa Ka-band altimeter and the SIRAL altimeter on CryoSat-2 that can be operated in SAR mode. A case study along the UK coast demonstrates the good agreement between coastal altimetry and tide gauge observations, with root mean square differences as low as 4 cm at many stations, allowing the characterization of the annual cycle of sea level along the UK coasts. Finally, we examine the evolution of the sea level trend from the open to the coastal ocean along the western coast of Africa, comparing standard and coastally improved products. Different products give different sea level trend profiles, so the recommendation is that additional efforts are needed to study sea level trends in the coastal zone from past and present satellite altimeters. Further improvements are expected from more refined processing and screening of data, but in particular from the constant improvements in the geophysical corrections.},

abstract = {Sea surface temperatures of the northwest Atlantic have warmed dramatically over the last several decades, while benthic temperatures have increased at a slower pace. Here we analyze a subset of the CMIP5 global Earth system model ensemble using a statistical downscaling approach to determine potential future changes in benthic temperatures on the northwest Atlantic continental shelf and slope ({\textless}500 m). We put future changes in the context of possible impacts of ocean warming on the high-value, wild-caught American Lobster (Homarus americanus) fishery. Future bottom temperatures of the northwest Atlantic under a business-as-usual (RCP8.5) and a climate-policy (RCP4.5) scenario are projected to increase by 0–1.58C and 1.2–2.48C by 2050 and 0–1.98C and 2.3–4.38C by the end of the century for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. H. americanus experiences thermal stress at temperatures above 208C, and projected increases in temperature is likely to result in changes in the distribution of optimal thermal egg hatching and settlement indicators. Inshore regions of southern New England, where H. americanus biomass and catch have been declining historically, will likely become inhospitable under either future scenario, while thermal egg hatching and settlement indicators will expand offshore and in the Gulf of Maine. These changes imply that members of the fishery based in southern New England may need to recapitalize to larger vessels to prepare for potential changes brought on by future climate warming. Results from the downscaling presented here can be useful in preparing for potential changes to other fisheries or in future climate vulnerability analyses.},

A new adaptive Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm has been proposed to automatically extract the seafloor photons from the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) Level 2A data after applying tide and refraction corrections. Later, these depth points were used in place of the in situ bathymetric points to train (with 80{\%} of data) the SVR model. With trained models and Sentinel-2 multispectral images of 2019, the bathymetric maps were produced. The performance of the models was evaluated using remaining independent (20{\%}) data points from ICESat-2. The results indicate that the overall errors during the test phase for the range of depth (0–25 m) are 0.60 (0.47 m) and 0.41 m (0.32 m) based on Log-Ratio Model—LRM—(Log Linear Model—LLM) methods in Neil and Havelock Islands, respectively. The LLM-based SVR ML produced relatively accurate bathymetry as compared to the LRM approach over the entire depth range. Therefore, this approach can be extended to produce large-scale bathymetry maps in shallow waters of other islands and reefs along Indian coastal waters.},

abstract = {Coastal zones are exposed to a range of coastal hazards including sea-level rise with its related effects. At the same time, they are more densely populated than the hinterland and exhibit higher rates of population growth and urbanisation. As this trend is expected to continue into the future, we investigate how coastal populations will be affected by such impacts at global and regional scales by the years 2030 and 2060. Starting from baseline population estimates for the year 2000, we assess future population change in the low-elevation coastal zone and trends in exposure to 100-year coastal floods based on four different sea-level and socio-economic scenarios. Our method accounts for differential growth of coastal areas against the land-locked hinterland and for trends of urbanisation and expansive urban growth, as currently observed, but does not explicitly consider possible displacement or out-migration due to factors such as sea-level rise. We combine spatially explicit estimates of the baseline population with demographic data in order to derive scenario-driven projections of coastal population development. Our scenarios show that the number of people living in the low-elevation coastal zone, as well as the number of people exposed to flooding from 1-in-100 year storm surge events, is highest in Asia. China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam are estimated to have the highest total coastal population exposure in the baseline year and this ranking is expected to remain largely unchanged in the future. However, Africa is expected to experience the highest rates of population growth and urbanisation in the coastal zone, particularly in Egypt and sub-Saharan countries in Western and Eastern Africa. The results highlight countries and regions with a high degree of exposure to coastal flooding and help identifying regions where policies and adaptive planning for building resilient coastal communities are not only desirable but essential. Furthermore, we identify needs for further research and scope for improvement in this kind of scenario-based exposure analysis.},

abstract = {Mangroves form coastal tropical forests in the intertidal zone and are an important component of shoreline protection. In comparison to other tropical forests, mangrove stands are thought to have relatively low genetic diversity with population genetic structure gradually increasing with distance along a coastline. We conducted genetic analyses of mangrove forests across a range of spatial scales; within a 400 m2 parcel comprising 181 Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) trees, and across four sites ranging from 6–115 km apart in Honduras. In total, we successfully genotyped 269 R. mangle trees, using a panel of 677 SNPs developed with 2b-RAD methodology. Within the 400 m2 parcel, we found two distinct clusters with high levels of genetic differentiation (FST = 0.355), corresponding to trees primarily located on the seaward fringe and trees growing deeper into the forest. In contrast, there was limited genetic differentiation (FST = 0.027–0.105) across the sites at a larger scale, which had been predominantly sampled along the seaward fringe. Within the 400 m2 parcel, the cluster closest to the seaward fringe exhibited low genetic differentiation (FST = 0.014–0.043) with the other Honduran sites, but the cluster further into the forest was highly differentiated from them (FST = 0.326–0.414). These findings contradict the perception that genetic structure within mangroves forests occurs mainly along a coastline and highlights that there is greater genetic structure at fine spatial scales.},

abstract = {The Sundarbans, the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world, covers 6,017 km2 of the coastal zone of Bangladesh. Heritiera fomes Buch.-Ham., Excoecaria agallocha L. and Ceriops decandra (Griff.) Ding Hou jointly cover 95{\%} of the forest area. In this study, the results of four forest inventories have been analyzed to understand observed vegetation dynamics of the Sundarbans from 1926 to 1997. The diversity of forest types has been gradually reduced over time, but H. fomes and E. agallocha have maintained their dominance over large portions of the forest. H. fomes is spread over 67{\%} of the vegetated area of the forest, concentrated mostly in the northeastern area, and constitutes 75{\%} of the density of trees with {\textgreater}15 cm dbh. The distribution and stem density of H. fomes show negative relationships with that of E. agallocha and C. decandra. In terms of coverage, E. agallocha is the most common species, spread over 74{\%} of the vegetated area of the forest, and constitutes 39{\%} of the density of trees with {\textgreater}2.5 cm dbh. On a longer timeframe (1926-1997), the dominance (coverage and density of larger diameter trees) of H. fomes as well as that of E. agallocha is declining. Even on parameters such as density of trees with {\textgreater}15 cm dbh, the dominance of E. agallocha is declining at a much greater rate than H. fomes. This observation contradicts the successional schemes proposed by different authors. This might indicate that theorizing successional schemes based on short-term observations on vegetation dynamics is not sufficient. The effect of human interference, changes in hydroedaphic condition and species interaction should be taken into consideration during explaining observed vegetation dynamics. Moreover, the need to understand vegetation trajectories at the micro-scale should be emphasized. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Coastal areas epitomize the notion of ‘at-risk' territory in the context of climate change and sea level rise (SLR). Knowledge of the water level changes at the coast resulting from the mean sea level variability, tide, atmospheric surge and wave setup is critical for coastal flooding assessment. This study investigates how coastal water level can be altered by interactions between SLR, tides, storm surges, waves and flooding. The main mechanisms of interaction are identified, mainly by analyzing the shallow water equations. Based on a literature review, the orders of magnitude of these interactions are estimated in different environments. The investigated interactions exhibit a strong spatiotemporal variability. Depending on the type of environments (e.g., morphology, hydrometeorological context), they can reach several tens of centimeters (positive or negative). As a consequence, probabilistic projections of future coastal water levels and flooding should identify whether interaction processes are of leading order, and, where appropriate, projections should account for these interactions through modeling or statistical methods.},

abstract = {Shallow nearshore coastal waters provide a wealth of societal, economic, and ecosystem services, yet their topographic structure is poorly mapped due to a reliance upon expensive and time intensive methods. Space-borne bathymetric mapping has helped address these issues, but has remained largely dependent upon in situ measurements. Here we fuse ICESat-2 lidar data with Sentinel-2 optical imagery, within the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, to create openly available spatially continuous high-resolution bathymetric maps at regional-to-national scales in Florida, Crete and Bermuda. ICESat-2 bathymetric classified photons are used to train three Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) methods, including Lyzenga, Stumpf, and Support Vector Regression algorithms. For each study site the Lyzenga algorithm yielded the lowest RMSE (approx. 10{\%}–15{\%}) when compared with validation data. We demonstrate a means of using ICESat-2 for both model calibration and validation, thus cementing a pathway for fully space-borne estimates of nearshore bathymetry in shallow, clear water environments.},

abstract = {In this study we present and validate a simple empirical method to obtain bathymetry profiles using the geolocated photon data from the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission, which was launched by NASA in September 2018. The satellite carries the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), which is a lidar that can detect single photons and calculate their bounce point positions. ATLAS uses a green laser, causing some of the photons to penetrate the air–water interface. Under the right conditions and in shallow waters ({\textless}40 m), these photons are reflected back to ATLAS after interaction with the ocean bottom. Using ICESat-2 data from four different overflights above the Heron Reef, Australia, a comparison with SDB data showed a median absolute deviation of approximately 18 cm and Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) down to 28 cm. Crossovers between two different overflights above the Heron Reef showed a median absolute difference of 13 cm. For an area north-west of Sisimiut, Greenland, the comparison was done with multibeam echo sounding data, with RMSEs down to between 35 cm, and correspondingly showed median absolute deviations between 33 and 49 cm. The proposed method works well under good conditions with clear waters such as in the Great Barrier Reef; however, for more difficult areas a more advanced machine learning technique should be investigated in order to find an automated method that can distinguish between bathymetry and other signals and noise.},

abstract = {The high importance of bathymetric character for many processes on reefs means that high-resolution bathymetric models are commonly needed by marine scientists and coastal managers. Empirical and optimisation methods provide two approaches for deriving bathymetry from multispectral satellite imagery, which have been refined and widely applied to coral reefs over the last decade. This paper compares these two approaches by means of a geographical error analysis for two sites on the Great Barrier Reef: Lizard Island (a continental island fringing reef) and Sykes Reef (a planar platform reef). The geographical distributions of model residuals (i.e., the difference between modelled and measured water depths) are mapped, and their spatial autocorrelation is calculated as a basis for comparing the performance of the bathymetric models. Comparisons reveal consistent geographical properties of errors arising from both models, including the tendency for positive residuals (i.e., an under-prediction of depth) in shallower areas and negative residuals in deeper areas (i.e., an over-prediction of depth) and the presence of spatial autocorrelation in model errors. A spatial error model is used to generate more reliable estimates of bathymetry by quantifying the spatial structure (autocorrelation) of model error and incorporating this into an improved regression model. Spatial error models improve bathymetric estimates derived from both methods.},

abstract = {A mass-balance model using upper-air meteorological data for input was calibrated with surface mass balance measured mainly during 1977–78 at 67 sites on Columbia Glacier, Alaska, between 135 and 2645 m a.s.l. Root-mean-square error, model vs measured, is 1.0 m w.e. a−1, with r
               2 = 0.88. A remarkable result of the analysis was that both precipitation and the factor in the positive degree-day model used to estimate surface ablation were constant with altitude. The model was applied to reconstruct glacier-wide components of surface mass balance over 1948–2007. Surface ablation, 4 km3 ice eq. a−1 (ice equivalent), has changed little throughout the period. From 1948 until about 1981, when drastic retreat began, the surface mass balance was positive but changes in glacier geometry were small, so the positive balance was offset by calving, ∼0.9 km3 ice eq. a−1 . During retreat, volume loss of the glacier accounted for 92{\%} of the iceberg production. Calving increased to ∼4.3 km3 ice eq. a−1 from 1982 to 1995, and after that until 2007 to ∼8.0 km3 ice eq. a−1, which was about twice the loss by surface ablation, whereas prior to retreat it was only about a quarter as much. Calving is calculated as the difference between glacier-wide surface mass balance and geodetically determined volume change.},

Since ICESat-1/GLAS has facilitated scientific results in the field of forest structure parameter estimation, how to use the ICESat-2/ATLAS photon cloud data to estimate forest structure parameters has become a hotspot in the field of spaceborne photon data application. However, due to the weak photon characteristics of the ICESat-2/ATLAS system, the system is extremely susceptible to noise, which poses a challenge for its subsequent accurate estimation of forest structural parameters. Aiming to filter out the noise photons, the paper introduces the advantages of the spaceborne lidar system ICESat-2/ATLAS than ICESat-1/GLAS.

abstract = {Dispersal in Avicennia marina was related to attributes of the propagules and their response to environmental conditions. Viability of propagules and periods of their dispersal were measured in field experiments. Propagules extended their hypocotyl and developed root primordia within a few weeks, hence the phase of obligate dispersal is about 1 week. However, propagules remain viable, either exposed by tides or totally submerged, for up to 5 months during enforced dispersal. The fates of propagules were followed in two types of tidal creek over three tidal cycles. Newly released propagules are mostly moved on the initial flood tide and strand at the high tide mark less than 500 m from the point of their release. Buoyancy of the propagules, tides and currents mainly determine patterns of seedlings within undisturbed mangrove stands. Observations of propagules washed onto beaches show that most strand within 1 km of an estuary, and very few propagules were observed to disperse more than 10 km. Dispersal between populations is likely to be a rare event in southeastern Australia because of low numbers of floating propagules, the discontinuous distribution of habitat and the hazards of recruitment. This has two consequences: first, it may restrict gene flow among populations; second, recovery from mass mortality within an estuary will be slow. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Coastal flood impact assessments are important tools for risk management and are performed by combining the hazard component with the vulnerability of exposed assets, to quantify consequences (or impacts) in terms of relative or absolute (e.g. financial) damage. The process generates uncertainties that should be taken into account for the correct representation of the consequences of floods. This study presents a coastal flood impact application at the spatial level of the Stavanger municipality (Norway), based on a multi-damage model approach able to represent impacts, and their overall uncertainty. Hazard modelling was performed using the LISFLOOD-FP code, taking into account historical extreme water level events (1988–2017) and relative sea level rise scenarios. Direct impacts were calculated in the form of relative and financial damage for different building categories, using flood damage curves. The results showed that the expected impacts are fewer than 50 flooded receptors and less than €1 million in damage in the current sea level scenario. The impacts could double by the end of the century, considering the most optimistic relative sea level scenario. The results were discussed considering the limitations of the approach for both hazard and impact modelling, that will be improved in future implementations. The outcome of this study may be useful for cost–benefit analyses of mitigation actions and local-scale plans for adaptation.},

abstract = {ICESat-2 science requirements are dependent on the accurate real-time pointing control (i.e., geolocation control) and postprocessed geolocation knowledge of the laser altimeter surface returns. Prelaunch pointing alignment errors and postlaunch pointing alignment variation result in large geolocation errors that must be calibrated on orbit. In addition, the changing sun-orbit geometry causes thermal-mechanical forced laser frame alignment variations at the orbit period and trends from days, weeks, and months. Early mission analysis computed precise postlaunch laser beam alignment calibration. The alignment calibration was uploaded to the spacecraft and enabled the pointing control performance to achieve 4.4 ± 6.0 m, a significant improvement over the 45 m (1 $\sigma$) mission requirement. Laser frame alignment calibrations are used to reduce the alignment bias and time variation, as well as the orbital variation contributions to geolocation knowledge error from 6 to 1.7 m (1 $\sigma$). Relative beam alignment of the six beams is calibrated and shown to contribute between 0.5 ± 0.1 m and 2.4 ± 0.2 m of remaining geolocation knowledge error. Independent geolocation assessment based on comparison to high-resolution digital elevation models agrees well with the calibration geolocation error estimates. The analysis demonstrates the ICESat-2 mission is performing far better than its geolocation knowledge requirement of 6.5 m (1 $\sigma$) after the laser frame alignment bias variation and orbital variation calibrations have been applied. Remaining geolocation error is beam dependent and ranges from 2.5 m for beam 6 to 4.4 m for beam 2 (mean + 1 $\sigma$).},

It has been found that the results of the design formulae are sensitive to the choice of input parameters (H1/3 or Hm0 and Tm or Tm-1,0) and that the inclusion of the reduction factor for breaking waves (H2{\%}/Hs) in the design formulae should be applied only with caution, depending on the choice of input parameters. These results apply for the conditions tested and should be verified for other foreshore configurations before a definite recommendation pertaining to the use of the Van der Meer formulae for shallow foreshores can be given.},

abstract = {Timely and up-to-date bathymetry maps over large geographical areas have been difficult to create, due to the cost and difficulty of collecting in-situ calibration and validation data. Recently, combinations of spaceborne ICESat-2 lidar data and Landsat/Sentinel-2 data have reduced these obstacles. However, to date there have been no means of automatically extracting bathymetry photons from ICESat-2 tracks for model calibra-tion/validation and no well established open source workflows for generating regional scale bathymetric models. Here we provide an open source approach for generating bathymetry maps for the shallow water region around the island of Andros, Bahamas. We demonstrate an efficient means of processing 224 ICESat-2 tracks and 221 Landsat-8 scenes, using the C-SHELPh algorithm and Extra Trees Regression to provide 30 m pixel estimates of per-pixel depth and standard error. We map bathymetry with an RMSE of 0.32 m and RMSE{\%} of 6.7 {\%}. Our workflow and results demonstrate a means of achieving accurate regional-scale bathymetry maps from purely spaceborne data.

abstract = {The International Height Reference System (IHRS), adopted by International Association of Geodesy (IAG) in its Resolution No. 1 at the XXVI General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) in Prague in 2015, contains two novelties. Firstly, the mean-tide concept is adopted for handling the permanent tide. While many national height systems continue to apply the mean-tide concept, this was the first time that the IAG officially introduced it for a potential field quantity. Secondly, the reference level of the height system is defined by the equipotential surface where the geopotential has a conventional value W0 = 62,636,853.4 m2 s–2. This value was first determined empirically to provide a good approximation to the global mean sea level and then adopted as a reference value by convention. I analyse the tidal aspects of the reference level based on W0. By definition, W0 is independent of the tidal concept that was adopted for the equipotential surface, but for different concepts, different functions are involved in the W of the equation W = W0. I find that, in the empirical determination of the adopted estimate W0, the permanent tide is treated inconsistently. However, the consistent estimate from the same data rounds off to the same value. I discuss the tidal conventions and formulas for the International Height Reference Frame (IHRF) and the realisation of the IHRS. I propose a simplified definition of IHRF geopotential numbers that would make it possible to transform between the IHRF and zero-tide geopotential numbers using a simple datum-difference surface. Such a transformation would not be adequate if rigorous mean-tide formulas were imposed. The IHRF should adopt a conventional (best) estimate of the permanent tide-generating potential, such as that which is contained in the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service Conventions, and use it as a basis for other conventional formulas. The tide-free coordinates of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame and tide-free Global Geopotential Models are central in the modelling of geopotential for the purposes of the IHRF. I present a set of correction formulas that can be used to move to the zero-tide model before, during, or after the processing, and finally to the mean-tide IHRF. To reduce the confusion around the multitude of tidal concepts, I propose that modelling should primarily be done using the zero-tide concept, with the mean-tide potential as an add-on. The widespread use of the expression “systems of permanent tide” may also have contributed to the confusion, as such “systems” do not have the properties that are generally associated with other “systems” in geodesy. Hence, this paper mostly uses “concept” instead of “system” when referring to the permanent tide.},

abstract = {The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provides a new measurement strategy thanks to an advanced topographic laser altimeter system that uses photon counting technology for highly accurate nearshore bathymetry and underwater topographic mapping. In this technique, however, the refraction of water leads to a displacement of the position of the photons on the seafloor, which reduces the accuracy of the measurement. To overcome this problem, a novel refraction correction approach constructed on the ray tracing and JONSWAP spectrum is proposed in this study for ICESat-2. In this method, the coordinate compensation of each seafloor photon was applied in the WGS84 coordinate system to improve the positioning precision of seafloor photons. Experimental results showed that the proposed refraction correction method could precisely reduce the displacement of each photon on the seafloor. For the displacement elimination and coordinate compensation, the highest accuracy of photon counting measurements for the seafloor profile could reach −0.29 m of bias and 0.42 m of root mean square error in our study area. Finally, the influence of the Earth's curvature on the refraction correction was analyzed in detail, revealing that curvature displacement ranged in value between −5 and −6 power. Therefore, it was considered negligible in terms of its effects on underwater topography and nearshore bathymetry mapping.},

abstract = {Total water levels (TWLs) at the coast are driven by a combination of deterministic (e.g., tides) and stochastic (e.g., waves, storm surge, and sea level anomalies) processes. The contribution of each process to TWLs varies depending on regional differences in climate and framework geology, as well as local-scale variations in beach morphology, coastal orientation, and shelf bathymetry. Large-scale changes to the climate altering the frequency, direction, and intensity of storms, may therefore propagate to the nearshore differently, amplifying or suppressing local coastal hazards and changing the exposure of coastal communities to extreme TWLs. This study investigates the hydrodynamic and geomorphologic factors controlling local TWLs along high-energy United States coastlines where wave-influences dominate TWLs. Three study sites in the states of Washington, Oregon, and California are chosen to explore how regional and local differences in beach topography and wave transformation over shelf bathymetry drives variations in the magnitude and impacts of extreme TWLs. Results indicate that TWLs are most influenced by wave transformation processes in locations with steep beach slopes and complex offshore bathymetry, while beach topography influences the severity of coastal impacts. Once the relative morphologic controls on TWLs are better understood, hypothetical future climate scenarios are explored to assess how changes to the average deepwater wave climate (height, period, and direction) may alter local TWLs when compared to estimates of likely sea level rise and future coastal management strategies. Changes to the wave climate are found to be as detrimental to the coastline as sea level rise in some locations, where small variations of the TWL drive large, nonlinear changes in hours of impact to the backshore beach. Overall, this study develops an approach for quantifying the range of hydrodynamic and morphologic controls on the magnitude of TWLs which will ultimately better prepare coastal communities for uncertain changes to the global climate.},

abstract = {Timely observations of nearshore water depths are important for a variety of coastal research and management topics, yet this information is expensive to collect using in situ survey methods. Remote methods to estimate bathymetry from imagery include using either ratios of multi-spectral reflectance bands or inversions from wave processes. Multi-spectral methods work best in waters with low turbidity, and wave-speed-based methods work best when wave breaking is minimal. In this work, we build on the wave-based inversion approaches, by exploring the use of a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) to infer nearshore bathymetry from imagery of the sea surface and local wave statistics. We apply transfer learning to adapt a CNN originally trained on synthetic imagery generated from a Boussinesq numerical wave model to utilize tower-based imagery collected in Duck, North Carolina, at the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center{\&}rsquo;s Field Research Facility. We train the model on sea-surface imagery, wave conditions, and associated surveyed bathymetry using three years of observations, including times with significant wave breaking in the surf zone. This is the first time, to the authors{\&}rsquo; knowledge, an FCNN has been successfully applied to infer bathymetry from surf-zone sea-surface imagery. Model results from a separate one-year test period generally show good agreement with survey-derived bathymetry (0.37 m root-mean-squared error, with a max depth of 6.7 m) under diverse wave conditions with wave heights up to 3.5 m. Bathymetry results quantify nearshore bathymetric evolution including bar migration and transitions between single- and double-barred morphologies. We observe that bathymetry estimates are most accurate when time-averaged input images feature visible wave breaking and/or individual images display wave crests. An investigation of activation maps, which show neuron activity on a layer-by-layer basis, suggests that the model is responsive to visible coherent wave structures in the input images.},

Location: Global, covering 99{\%} of all mangrove forests. Methods: We synthesized the Global Forest Change database, the Terrestrial Ecosystems of the World database and the Mangrove Forests of the World database to extract mangrove forest cover at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We then used the new database to monitor mangrove cover at the global, national and protected area scales. Results: Countries showing relatively high amounts of mangrove loss include Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia and Guatemala. Indonesia remains by far the largest mangrove-holding nation, containing between 26{\%} and 29{\%} of the global mangrove inventory with a deforestation rate of between 0.26{\%} and 0.66{\%} per year. We have made our new database, CGMFC-21, freely available. Main conclusions: Global mangrove deforestation continues but at a much reduced rate of between 0.16{\%} and 0.39{\%} per year. Southeast Asia is a region of concern with mangrove deforestation rates between 3.58{\%} and 8.08{\%}, this in a region containing half of the entire global mangrove forest inventory. The global mangrove deforestation pattern from 2000 to 2012 is one of decreasing rates of deforestation, with many nations essentially stable, with the exception of the largest mangrove-holding region of Southeast Asia. We provide a standardized spatial dataset that monitors mangrove deforestation globally at high spatio-temporal resolutions. These data can be used to drive the mangrove research agenda, particularly as it pertains to monitoring of mangrove carbon stocks and the establishment of baseline local mangrove forest inventories required for payment for ecosystem service initiatives.},

abstract = {The log-ratio method (LRM) proposed by Stumpf et al. has been widely used to map bathymetry from multispectral imagery for oligotrophic waters, while the selection criteria of bands for the LRM have been subject to tradeoffs between maximum detectable depth and sensitivity. In this article, we first applied a method for global sensitivity analysis to a semianalytical forward model of optically shallow waters with the WorldView-2 band-set. The results show that the sensitive wavelength band in water-leaving reflectance for water depth varies from the longer wavelength band to the shorter wavelength band with increasing water depth. Then, we developed an adaptive blended algorithm approach (ABAA) to seamlessly map bathymetry from the shallower region to the deeper region. The LRM with different band combinations was selected for the sub-algorithms of the ABAA. The subalgorithms and depth range used for each subalgorithm of the ABAA were automatically determined by the proposed applicable depth range analysis that considers logarithmic regression for the LRM. The ABAA was applied to WorldView-2 and Landsat-8 imagery of the Xisha Qundao. When the in situ bathymetry data are available, compared with the LRM with the blue and green bands, the ABAA significantly improves the accuracy of the estimated depth, especially for waters shallower than 6 m (root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.31 to 0.94 m for WorldView-2 data, RMSE= 0.25 to 1.42 m for Landsat-8 data). When the in situ bathymetry data are absent, the ABAA performs better than the LRM with a single band ratio and an optimization-based method overall.},

abstract = {Great Barrier Reef catchments are under pressure from the effects of climate change, landscape modifications, and hydrology alterations. With the use of remote sensing datasets covering large areas, conventional methods of change detection can expose broad transitions, whereas workflows that excerpt data for time-series trends divulge more subtle transformations of land cover modification. Here, we combine both these approaches to investigate change and trends in a large estuarine region of Central Queensland, Australia, that encompasses a national park and is adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage site. Nine information classes were compiled in a maximum likelihood post classification change analysis in 2004-2017. Mangroves decreased (1146 hectares), as was the case with estuarine wetland (1495 hectares), and saltmarsh grass (1546 hectares). The overall classification accuracies and Kappa coefficient for 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2017 land cover maps were 85{\%}, 88{\%}, 88{\%}, 89{\%}, 81{\%}, and 92{\%}, respectively. The cumulative area of open forest, estuarine wetland, and saltmarsh grass (1628 hectares) was converted to pasture in a thematic change analysis showing the "from-to" change. We generated linear regression relationships to examine trends in pixel values across the time series. Our findings from a trend analysis showed a decreasing trend (p value range = 0.001-0.099) in the vegetation extent of open forest, fringing mangroves, estuarine wetlands, saltmarsh grass, and grazing areas, but this was inconsistent across the study site. Similar to reports from tropical regions elsewhere, saltmarsh grass is poorly represented in the national park. A severe tropical cyclone preceding the capture of the 2017 Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image was likely the main driver for reduced areas of shoreline and stream vegetation. Our research contributes to the body of knowledge on coastal ecosystem dynamics to enable planning to achieve more effective conservation outcomes.},

Satellite-derived bathymetry represents a time saving method to map large shallow waters of remote regions compared to the current costly in situ measurement techniques. This study aims to create very high-resolution (VHR) bathymetry and habitat mapping in Mayotte island waters (Indian Ocean) by fusing 0.5 m Pleiades-1 passive multispectral imagery and active ICESat-2 LiDAR bathymetry. ICESat-2 georeferenced photons were filtered to remove noise and corrected for water column refraction. The bathymetric point clouds were validated using the French naval hydrographic and oceanographic service Litto3D{\textregistered} dataset and then used to calibrate the multispectral image to produce a digital depth model (DDM). The latter enabled the creation of a digital albedo model used to classify benthic habitats. ICESat-2 provided bathymetry down to 15 m depth with a vertical accuracy of bathymetry estimates reaching 0.89 m. The benthic habitats map produced using the maximum likelihood supervised classification provided an overall accuracy of 96.62{\%}. This study successfully produced a VHR DDM solely from satellite data. Digital models of higher accuracy were further discussed in the light of the recent and near-future launch of higher spectral and spatial resolution satellites.},

abstract = {Due to rapid losses of mangrove forests caused by anthropogenic disturbances and climate change, accurate and contemporary maps of mangrove forests are needed to understand how mangrove ecosystems are changing and establish plans for sustainable management. In this study, a new classification algorithm was developed using the biophysical characteristics of mangrove forests in China. More specifically, these forests were mapped by identifying: (1) greenness, canopy coverage, and tidal inundation from time series Landsat data, and (2) elevation, slope, and intersection-with-sea criterion. The annual mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was found to be a key variable in determining the classification thresholds of greenness, canopy coverage, and tidal inundation of mangrove forests, which are greatly affected by tide dynamics. In addition, the integration of Sentinel-1A VH band and modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI) shows great potential in identifying yearlong tidal and fresh water bodies, which is related to mangrove forests. This algorithm was developed using 6 typical Regions of Interest (ROIs) as algorithm training and was run on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to process 1941 Landsat images (25 Path/Row) and 586 Sentinel-1A images circa 2015. The resultant mangrove forest map of China at 30 m spatial resolution has an overall/users/producer's accuracy greater than 95{\%} when validated with ground reference data. In 2015, China's mangrove forests had a total area of 20,303 ha, about 92{\%} of which was in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangdong, and Hainan Provinces. This study has demonstrated the potential of using the GEE platform, time series Landsat and Sentine-1A SAR images to identify and map mangrove forests along the coastal zones. The resultant mangrove forest maps are likely to be useful for the sustainable management and ecological assessments of mangrove forests in China.},

abstract = {The restoration of mangroves has received a lot of attention world wide for several reasons. Firstly, the long ignored ecological and environmental values of mangrove forests have been documented for many mangrove areas in the world. Secondly, there is a high subsistence dependence on natural resources from mangrove forests. In addition, large losses of mangroves have occurred throughout the world leading to coastal erosion, decline of fishery resources and other environmental consequences, some of which in need of urgent attention. Finally, governments throughout the world are showing commitments towards sustainable use of mangrove areas. This paper outlines the activities of mangrove restoration and management around the world with particular emphasis on Eastern Africa. As noted here, extensive research has been carried out on the ecology, structure and functioning of the mangrove ecosystem. However, the findings have not been interpreted in a management framework, thus mangrove forests around the world continue to be over-exploited, converted to aquaculture ponds, and polluted. We strongly argue that links between research and sustainable management of mangrove ecosystems should be established.},

abstract = {The accurate estimation of nearshore bathymetry is necessary for multiple aspects of coastal research and practices. The traditional shipborne single-beam/multi-beam echo sounders and Airborne Lidar bathymetry (ALB) have a high cost, are inefficient, and have sparse coverage. The Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) method has been proven to be a promising tool in obtaining bathymetric data in shallow water. However, current empirical SDB methods for multispectral imagery data usually rely on in situ depths as control points, severely limiting their spatial application. This study proposed a satellite-derived bathymetry method without requiring a priori in situ data by merging active and passive remote sensing (SDB-AP). It realizes rapid bathymetric mapping with only satellite remotely sensed data, which greatly extends the spatial coverage and temporal scale. First, seafloor photons were detected from the ICESat-2 raw photons based on an improved adaptive Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, which could calculate the optimal detection parameters for seafloor photons by adaptive iteration. Then, the bathymetry of the detected seafloor photons was corrected because of the refraction that occurs at the air–water interface. Afterward, the outlier photons were removed by an outlier-removal algorithm to improve the retrieval accuracy. Subsequently, the high spatial resolution (0.7 m) ICESat-2 derived bathymetry data were gridded to match the Sentinel-2 data with a lower spatial resolution (10 m). All of the ICESate-2 gridded data were randomly separated into two parts: 80{\%} were employed to train the empirical bathymetric model, and the remaining 20{\%} were used to quantify the inversion accuracy. Finally, after merging the ICESat-2 data and Sentinel-2 multispectral images, the bathymetric maps over St. Thomas of the United States Virgin Islands, Acklins Island in the Bahamas, and Huaguang Reef in the South China Sea were produced. The ICESat-2-derived results were compared against in situ data over the St. Thomas area. The results showed that the estimated bathymetry reached excellent inversion accuracy and the corresponding RMSE was 0.68 m. In addition, the RMSEs between the SDB-AP estimated depths and the ICESat-2 bathymetry results of St. Thomas, Acklins Island, and Huaguang Reef were 0.96 m, 0.91 m, and 0.94 m, respectively. Overall, the above results indicate that the SDB-AP method is effective and feasible for different shallow water regions. It has great potential for large-scale and long-term nearshore bathymetry in the future.},

abstract = {The southwest coastal delta of Bangladesh is not only geographically home to a dynamic interplay between land and water, and between fresh surface water and saline tides, but also to contentious debates on flood management policy. It has been argued that dealing with delta floods in this region boils down to adopting either open or closed approaches. This paper longitudinally structures the open-or-closed debate based on a number of emblematic water management projects in the region. Departing from a typical open wetland history, river and polder embankments increasingly started to constrain flood dynamics. Upheaval among rural populations in response to the negative impacts of hydraulic engineering plans and works coalesced in efforts to restore open approaches, synthesized in the Tidal River Management concept. Its resemblance to historic overflow irrigation is often used politically as a yardstick to challenge the dominant hydraulic engineering paradigm. This paper argues that dealing with floods in Bangladesh requires plans, policies and projects formulated against the historic background of complex interactions among social processes, environmental dynamics and technological interventions: a lesson to be incorporated in on-going policy-making processes and long-term delta management plans.},
