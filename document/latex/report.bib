  abstract = {Floods are the most devastating of global natural disasters, and flood adaptation measures are needed to reduce future risk. Researchers have started to evaluate the costs and benefits of flood adaptation, but information regarding the cost of different flood adaptation measures is often not available or is hidden in non-peer-reviewed literature. Recent review studies have explored cost estimates for different aspects of flood adaptation, such as nature-based solutions. This study aims to contribute empirical data regarding the cost of flood adaptation by compiling peer-reviewed literature and research reports. The focus is on construction costs and expenses for operation and maintenance. This paper integrates the unit cost information of six main flood adaptation measure categories: (1) the flood-proofing of buildings, (2) flood protection, (3) beach nourishment and dunes, (4) nature-based solutions for coastal ecosystems, (5) channel management and nature-based solutions for riverine systems, and (6) urban drainage. Cost estimates are corrected for inflation and converted to U.S. dollars (2016). Measures are described, and cost figures for both developed and developing countries are provided. The results of this study can be used as input for economic-assessment studies on flood adaptation measures.},

  abstract = {Nearshore slope, defined as the cross-shore gradient of the subaqueous profile, is an important input parameter which affects hydrodynamic and morphological coastal processes. It is used in both local and largescale coastal investigations. However, due to unavailability of data, most studies, especially those that focus on continental or global scales, have historically adopted a uniform nearshore slope. This simplifying assumption could however have far-reaching implications for predictions/projections thus obtained. Here, we present the first global dataset of nearshore slopes with a resolution of 1 km at almost 620 000 points along the global coastline. To this end, coastal profiles were constructed using global topo-bathymetric datasets. The results show that the nearshore slopes vary substantially around the world. An assessment of coastline recession driven by sea level rise (SLR) (for an arbitrary 0.5 m SLR) with a globally uniform coastal slope of 1 : 100, as carried out in previous studies, and with the spatially variable coastal slopes computed herein shows that, on average, the former approach would underestimate coastline recession by about 40 \%, albeit with significant spatial variation. The final dataset has been made publicly available at https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:a8297dcd-c34e-4e6d-bf669fb8913d983d (Athanasiou, 2019).},

  abstract = {Vegetation recovery in disturbance-driven ecosystems is difficult to predict. We demonstrate a concept to analyse time series for short-term variability in external forcing that can identify potential events for sudden vegetation recovery in biogeomorphic ecosystems such as saltmarshes, mangroves, dunes or floodplains. Time series of external forcing (i.e. water level and wind speed) were analysed for 'Windows of Opportunity' (WoO), defined as disturbance-free periods of a critical minimal duration directly following potential diaspore dispersal, which allow seedling establishment and can induce a sudden shift to a new persistent vegetation cover. Across different ecosystems, the minimal required WoO duration determines how many WoO events are available for seedling establishment. The distribution of WoO along an elevation gradient on riverbanks and in tidal systems, for example, is defined by the combination of the overall disturbance regime (e.g. seasonal vs. tidal flooding cycles) and the stochastic deviations from that regime (e.g. changes in weather conditions). Standardizing the WoO for the frequency of the regular disturbance regime shows that tidal and river systems have a similar relation between the required WoO length and the elevation suitable for establishment. WoO analysis correctly predicted a sudden vegetation recovery event in a saltmarsh case study. Synthesis. Time-series analysis for 'WoO' offers an important tool towards predicting the establishment of vegetation cover in disturbance-driven ecosystems and may have broader implications for understanding critical transitions in general. Quantifying the effects of stochastic external forcing on critical transitions in ecosystems is crucial for restoration efforts and to assess the effects of anthropogenic and global change. © 2014 British Ecological Society.},

Sea-level rise will increase flood risk, but substantial impacts could happen from reef loss alone without better near-term management. We provide a global, process-based valuation of an ecosystem service across an entire marine biome at (sub)national levels.

  abstract = {Deltas are inherently low-lying structures and thus subject to large threats due to sea level rise, erosion and other coastal processes. The shorelines in many deltas around the world are now retreating and most cases appear to result from a decreasing sediment supply as a consequence of upstream dam construction. We present here results of an investigation of riverine sediment fluxes, coastal retreat, and coastal sediment accumulation in the Chao Phraya River and Delta (Thailand). This deltaic shoreline has one of the highest rates of shoreline retreat in the world. Surprisingly, our results show that in spite of the construction of two large storage dams, one on the Ping River (Bhumibol Dam, 1964) and the other on the Nan River (Sirikit Dam, 1972) that merge to form the Chao Phraya, sediment accumulation in the delta was actually higher over the last several decades than prior to dam construction. The recent higher rates of sediment accumulation, based on 210Pb dating, appear to be the result of increased sediment supply in the lower reaches of the river relating to expansion of aquaculture and other activities in the delta beginning in the 1970s. We also show that mangrove removal, in order to further develop shrimp farming, charcoal production, and other pursuits, was not responsible for most of the shoreline erosion. Rather, subsidence, mainly induced by groundwater withdrawal, together with worldwide sea level rise appears to be the main factor affecting the very rapid shoreline retreat of the Chao Phraya Delta.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, population densities in coastal areas have strongly increased. At the same time, many intertidal coastal ecosystems that provide valuable services in terms of coastal protection have greatly degraded. As a result, coastal defense has become increasingly dependent on man-made engineering solutions. Ongoing climate change processes such as sea-level rise and increased storminess, require a rethinking of current coastal defense practices including the development of innovative and cost-effective ways to protect coastlines. Integrating intertidal coastal ecosystems within coastal defense schemes offers a promising way forward. In this perspective, we specifically aim to (1) provide insight in the conditions under which ecosystems may be valuable for coastal protection, (2) discuss which might be the most promising intertidal ecosystems for this task and (3) identify knowledge gaps that currently hamper application and hence need attention from the scientific community. Ecosystems can contribute most to coastal protection by wave attenuation in areas with relatively small tidal amplitudes, and/or where intertidal areas are wide. The main knowledge gap hampering application of intertidal ecosystems within coastal defense schemes is lack in ability to account quantitatively for long-term ecosystem dynamics. Such knowledge is essential, as this will determine both the predictability and reliability of their coastal defense function. Solutions integrating intertidal ecosystems in coastal defense schemes offer promising opportunities in some situations, but require better mechanistic understanding of ecosystem dynamics in space and time to enable successful large-scale application.},

Viability of propagules and periods of their dispersal were measured in field experiments. Propagules extended their hypocotyl and developed root primordia within a few weeks, hence the phase of obligate dispersal is about 1 week. However, propagules remain viable, either exposed by tides or totally submerged, for up to 5 months during enforced dispersal. The fates of propagules were followed in two types of tidal creek over three tidal cycles. Newly released propagules are mostly moved on the initial flood tide and strand at the high tide mark less than 500 m from the point of their release. Buoyancy of the propagules, tides and currents mainly determine patterns of seedlings within undisturbed mangrove stands. Observations of propagules washed onto beaches show that most strand within 1 km of an estuary, and very few propagules were observed to disperse more than 10 km. Dispersal between populations is likely to be a rare event in southeastern Australia because of low numbers of floating propagules, the discontinuous distribution of habitat and the hazards of recruitment. This has two consequences: first, it may restrict gene flow among populations; second, recovery from mass mortality within an estuary will be slow.},

  abstract = {Habitat restoration encompasses a broad range of activities, emphasizing very different issues, goals, and approaches depending on the operational definition of ‘restoration’. This is particularly true for many shellfish (molluscan) dominated systems (e.g. oyster reefs, mussel beds, vermetid gastropod reefs). In contrast to other well-studied biogenic habitats, such as seagrasses, mangroves, or salt marshes, bivalves are directly consumed as a resource. Hence resource extraction has direct consequences for habitat health. Restoration objectives have typically included reduction of public health risks through improved water quality to increase harvest. Restoration or enhancement of populations of commercially exploited shellfish depressed by overharvesting and/or reduced environmental quality remains the principal motivation behind most shellfish ‘restoration’ efforts. Direct and indirect ecosystem services (e.g. filtering capacity, benthic–pelagic coupling, nutrient dynamics, sediment stabilization, provision of habitat, etc.) derived from oyster habitat have been largely ignored or underestimated. Only recently, the restoration of lost ecological function associated with shellfish communities has been included in our discussions and related research examining habitat development and function through a scientific approach. The former area has been reviewed extensively and will not be our focus here. In this review, we examine some of the restoration efforts made in the name of fisheries enhancement, address their effectiveness, and discuss some of the issues associated with realizing the broader goal of ecological restoration. We note the importance of linking success criteria to specific goals and make the case for a greater need in clarifying the ecological functions of shellfish and shellfish habitats. We recognize the limitations of existing datasets and summarize ongoing attempts to address oyster habitat restoration throughout the broad geographic distribution of the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin). In many ways this topic parallels the ongoing debate over ‘attraction versus production’ associated with artificial reef management. We consider how local conditions (e.g. tidal range, bottom topography, turbidity, salinity) and resulting habitat traits affect restoration strategies. We also discuss the underappreciated value of shellfish populations from those areas designated as closed to harvesting due to their intrinsic worth as habitat/larval reserves. The necessity of ecosystem (adaptive) management strategies emerges from this discussion. Finally, this overview supports our contention that shellfish habitat should be included in discussions of ‘essential fish habitats’ (or EFH).},

These spatiotemporal inhomogeneities have implications for intertidal flat morphodynamics and ecology. We determine whether storm events are capable of altering the long-term morphological evolution of intertidal flats, and unravel the contributions of tidal flow, wind-driven flow, waves, and water depth on inhomogeneities in bed level dynamics (bed level changes over \textasciitilde days) across these areas. We complement decades of bed level measurements on eight intertidal flats in two estuaries in the Netherlands with an extensive 1-month field campaign on one of those flats. Across this intertidal flat, the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of a storm event were captured, including the post-storm recovery. We show that individual events can persistently alter the morphological evolution of intertidal flats; magnitudes of some bed level changes are even comparable to years of continuous evolution. The morphological impacts of events are largely controlled by the relative timing of the forcing processes, and not solely by their magnitudes. Spatiotemporal variations in bed level dynamics of intertidal flats are driven by a combination of: (1) the inhomogeneous distributions of the hydrodynamic forcing processes (including the under-explored role of the wind); and (2) the linear proportionality between bed level dynamics and the local bed slope. © 2020, The Author(s).},

The process generates uncertainties that should be taken into account for the correct representation of the consequences of floods. This study presents a coastal flood impact application at the spatial level of the Stavanger municipality (Norway), based on a multi-damage model approach able to represent impacts, and their overall uncertainty. Hazard modelling was performed using the LISFLOOD-FP code, taking into account historical extreme water level events (1988–2017) and relative sea level rise scenarios. Direct impacts were calculated in the form of relative and financial damage for different building categories, using flood damage curves. The results showed that the expected impacts are fewer than 50 flooded receptors and less than €1 million in damage in the current sea level scenario. The impacts could double by the end of the century, considering the most optimistic relative sea level scenario. The results were discussed considering the limitations of the approach for both hazard and impact modelling, that will be improved in future implementations. The outcome of this study may be useful for cost–benefit analyses of mitigation actions and local-scale plans for adaptation.},

  abstract = {The response of marine-terminating glaciers to changes in atmospheric and oceanic conditions is strongly dependent on glacier geometry. Glaciers occupying deep troughs or retrograde beds are prone to rapid retreat, whereas glaciers terminating in shallow water are much less sensitive to environmental perturbations. Thus, as a glacier's geometry evolves over time, so does its sensitivity to environmental perturbations. We use detailed observations from 2012-2016 for Alaska's Columbia Glacier and its former tributary (Post Glacier) to demonstrate how the influence of environmental forcing on iceberg calving and dynamic mass loss varies with glacier geometry. The effects of geometry on ice dynamics is apparent in both intra- and inter-annual retreat patterns of the glaciers, both in terms of magnitude and timing. Although intra-annual variations in terminus position are on the order of hundreds of meters, force budget time series reveal that seasonal speed variations are driven by the evolution of the subglacial hydrologic system and associated changes in basal drag rather than terminus position change. Seasonal variations in terminus position only drive noticeable speed change when the terminus retreats from 'sticky spots' (i.e., regions of relatively high basal drag). We also observed a shift in the timing of the annual cycle of terminus advance and retreat as Columbia's terminus retreated from a shallow shoal. When the terminus was grounded on the shoal, seasonal terminus retreat coincided with atmospheric warming, suggesting a link between surface melt, submarine melting, and/or calving. As Columbia's terminus retreated into deeper water, seasonal retreat was more influenced by changes in the ice flux. Although we focus on two glaciers, the physical controls on ice dynamics investigated here are not unique to the study glaciers. Thus, we suggest that changes in the timing of seasonal retreat reflect the manner by which glacier geometry mediates the calving response to meltwater and buoyancy. Based on the agreement between our observations and recent model results, we conclude that intra-annual records of terminus position change may offer a means to identify the primary controls on frontal ablation where sufficient in situ observations are lacking.},

  abstract = {This paper describes benchmark testing of a diffusive and an inertial formulation of the de St. Venant equations implemented within the LISFLOOD-FP hydraulic model using high resolution terrestrial LiDAR data. The models are applied to a hypothetical flooding scenario in a section of Alcester, UK which experienced significant surface water flooding in the June and July floods of 2007 in the UK. The sensitivity of water elevation and velocity simulations to model formulation and grid resolution are analyzed. The differences in depth and velocity estimates between the diffusive and inertial approximations are within 10\% of the simulated value but inertial effects persist at the wetting front in steep catchments. Both models portray a similar scale dependency between 50 cm and 5 m resolution which reiterates previous findings that errors in coarse scale topographic data sets are significantly larger than differences between numerical approximations. In particular, these results confirm the need to distinctly represent the camber and curbs of roads in the numerical grid when simulating surface water flooding events. Furthermore, although water depth estimates at grid scales coarser than 1 m appear robust, velocity estimates at these scales seem to be inconsistent compared to the 50 cm benchmark. The inertial formulation is shown to reduce computational cost by up to three orders of magnitude at high resolutions thus making simulations at this scale viable in practice compared to diffusive models. For the first time, this paper highlights the utility of high resolution terrestrial LiDAR data to inform small-scale flood risk management studies. Ó 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here, we describe the results of a study designed to quantify the effects of restoring oyster reefs in marsh tidal creeks on the mobile macrofauna. We used a before/after control/impact (BACI) design in which fishes and crustaceans within 6 tidal creeks were sampled 7 x before and 14 x after the addition of live oyster reefs to 3 of the tidal creeks. We detected no significant effects of the addition of oyster reefs on the overall fish or crustacean assemblages within the tidal creeks, and a weak positive effect on the abundance of demersal fishes. These results challenge current predictions that restoration of oyster reefs will result in an increase in mobile fauna. Our findings of no increase in mobile fauna may have resulted from the functional redundancy of a nearby biogenic habitat because reefs were placed in tidal creeks that were surrounded by dense salt marsh. We conclude that a positive correlation between mobile fauna and oyster habitat is not automatic, and that the role of the surrounding landscape is important in predicting the response of transient fish and crustaceans to oyster reef restoration.},

This study quantified resident (invertebrates) and transient (juvenile and piscivorous fish) fauna within restored intertidal oyster reefs and analogous control sites without reef habitat in each of three habitats (on the edge of salt marsh away from seagrass, on mudflats isolated from vegetated structures, and in between seagrass and salt marsh habitat). Reefs enhanced the abundance of resident invertebrates (e.g., polychaetes, nemerteans, epibenthic anemones, bivalves, and resident decapods) that comprise {$>$}90\% of juvenile fish prey biomass. However, the increase in food availability due to reef presence did not affect abundance of juvenile fish in either of the vegetated habitats, suggesting that resources may not limit juvenile fish when restored in these habitats. Only mudflat reefs augmented juvenile fish abundances, most likely due to a combination of greater resource availability and relative isolation from functionally equivalent habitats. In addition, lower abundances of piscivorous fish in mudflat reefs relative to control areas likely contributed to this pattern. Thus, community structure and important ecosystem functions such as secondary production depend on the spatial configuration of surrounding habitats, in much the same way that species interactions can depend on their biotic and abiotic context.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) loading to lakes is degrading the quality and usability of water globally. Accurate predictions of lake P dynamics are needed to understand whole-ecosystem P budgets, as well as the consequences of changing lake P concentrations for water quality. However, complex biophysical processes within lakes, along with limited observational data, challenge our capacity to reproduce short-term lake dynamics needed for water quality predictions, as well as long-term dynamics needed to understand broad scale controls over lake P. Here we use an emerging paradigm in modeling, process-guided machine learning (PGML), to produce a phosphorus budget for Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA) and to accurately predict epilimnetic phosphorus over a time range of days to decades. In our implementation of PGML, which we term a Process-Guided Recurrent Neural Network (PGRNN), we combine a process-based model for lake P with a recurrent neural network, and then constrain the predictions with ecological principles. We test independently the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN to evaluate the overall approach. The process-based model accounted for most of the observed pattern in lake P; however it missed the long-term trend in lake P and had the worst performance in predicting winter and summer P in surface waters. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN was 33.0 μg P L− 1, 22.7 μg P L− 1, and 20.7 μg P L− 1, respectively. All models performed better during summer, with RMSE values for the three models (same order) equal to 14.3 μg P L− 1, 10.9 μg P L− 1, and 10.7 μg P L− 1. Although the PGRNN had only marginally better RMSE during summer, it had lower bias and reproduced long-term decreases in lake P missed by the other two models. For all seasons and all years, the recurrent neural network had better predictions than process alone, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 23.8 μg P L− 1 and 28.0 μg P L− 1, respectively. The output of PGRNN indicated that new processes related to water temperature, thermal stratification, and long term changes in external loads are needed to improve the process model. By using ecological knowledge, as well as the information content of complex data, PGML shows promise as a technique for accurate prediction in messy, real-world ecological dynamics, while providing valuable information that can improve our understanding of process.},

  abstract = {Coastal flood damage and adaptation costs under 21st century sea-level rise are assessed on a global scale taking into account a wide range of uncertainties in continental topography data, population data, protection strategies, socioeconomic development and sea-level rise. Uncertainty in global mean and regional sea level was derived from four different climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, each combined with three land-ice scenarios based on the published range of contributions from ice sheets and glaciers. Without adaptation, 0.2–4.6\% of global population is expected to be flooded annually in 2100 under 25–123 cm of global mean sea-level rise, with expected annual losses of 0.3–9.3\% of global gross domestic product. Damages of this magnitude are very unlikely to be tolerated by society and adaptation will be widespread. The global costs of protecting the coast with dikes are significant with annual investment and maintenance costs of US\$ 12–71 billion in 2100, but much smaller than the global cost of avoided damages even without accounting for indirect costs of damage to regional production supply. Flood damages by the end of this century are much more sensitive to the applied protection strategy than to variations in climate and socioeconomic scenarios as well as in physical data sources (topography and climate model). Our results emphasize the central role of long-term coastal adaptation strategies. These should also take into account that protecting large parts of the developed coast increases the risk of catastrophic consequences in the case of defense failure.},

Therefore, understanding flood wave routing theory and solving the governing equations accurately is an important issue in hydrology and hydraulics. In an attempt to contribute to the understanding of this subject, in this study: ͑1͒ an analytical solution is derived for diffusion waves with constant wave celerity and hydraulic diffusivity applied to overland flow problems; and ͑2͒ an algorithm is developed using the MacCormack explicit finite difference method to solve the kinematic and diffusion wave governing equations for both overland and open channel flow. The MacCormack method is particularly well suited to approximate nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solutions provide the practicing engineer with computational speed in obtaining results for overland flow problems, and a means to check the validity of the numerical models. On the other hand, for larger scale catchment-stream problems, the verified numerical methods provide efficient and accurate algorithms to obtain solutions. Both the analytical approaches and the MacCormack algorithm are used to solve the same synthetic examples. Comparison of results shows that the numerical and analytical solutions are in close agreement. Furthermore, the MacCormack algorithm is applied to a real catchment: a segment of the Duke University West Campus storm water drainage system. In order to check the accuracy of the results obtained by the MacCormack method, the results are compared to predictions of the Environmental Protection Agency storm water management model ͑SWMM͒ as calibrated with measured rainfall and surface runoff flow data. The results obtained from SWMM are in good agreement with the results obtained from applying the MacCormack algorithm.},

The balance between floodplain formation and destruction determines the width and pattern of channels. Floodplain structure affects the style and rate of channel avulsion once aggradation takes place. Downstream fining of bed sediment and the sediment balance of fines in the pores of the bed sediment provide the ‘template’ or sediment boundary conditions, from which sorting at smaller scales leads to the formation of distinct channel patterns. Bar patterns provide the template of bank erosion and formation as well as the dynamics of the channel network through bifurcation destabilization. However, so far we have been unable to obtain dynamic meandering in laboratory experiments and in physics-based models that can also produce braiding, which reflects our lack of understanding of what causes the different river patterns.},

  abstract = {Coastal flood risk is expected to increase over the 21st century as a result of climate change and economic growth, which makes low-lying regions especially vulnerable. Global screening techniques are needed for a more widespread use of NBS in these flood prone coastal regions. This research expands on the current assessments done by developing a quantitative global screening method that evaluates the costs and benefits for two defence approaches; 1) increasing the dike height, 2) a hybrid solution that includes increasing of the dike height in combination with restoring mangroves and/or corals. The screening method is based on Van Oord’s Climate Risk Overview tool, in which, globally, coastal hotspots are indicated that have a predefined risk of flooding in the 21st century. The steps added by my screening method include; 1) determining which\&lt;br/\&gt;NBS can be applied depending on the local physical conditions, 2) determining the costs for both NBS and conventional hard solutions, 3) determining the increase/decrease in flood risk of the different interventions for current and future conditions, 4) monetizing additional benefits that NBS provide, 5) assessing the benefits and costs to determine if NBS are the most optimal solution. The results of this global method are inherently limited by several simplifying assumptions and by the lack of high resolution local data, which influences the cost/risk estimates and corresponding site identification. For 2.6-3.3\% of the coastal hotspots, NBS can reduce the investment costs in addition to being cost-beneficial. There is potential for expanding this work by adding sea grasses, salt marshes and oyster reefs as vegetated foreshore systems, and by including more thresholds to make the criterion for potential sites to apply NBS more strict.\&lt;br/\&gt;},

  abstract = {Effective management of coastal risks demands projections of flood hazards that account for a wide variety of potential sources of uncertainty. Two typical approaches for estimating flood hazards include (1) direct physical process-based modeling of the storms themselves and (2) statistical modeling of the distributions and relevant characteristics of extreme sea level events. Recently, flexible and efficient mechanistically-motivated models for sea-level change have become widely used for characterizing uncertainty in projections of mean sea levels [Oppenheimer and Alley, 2016]. In order to complement these models for mean sea levels, there is also a need for fast and flexible estimates of extreme sea levels, and corresponding uncertainties. This is the motivating factor in the focus within the SSPipeline (Storm Surge Pipeline) project, that characterizes uncertainty in estimates of extreme sea levels, using a statistical modeling approach. Specifically, the SSPipeline project ingests and processes raw sea-level data and fits a statistical distribution to the extreme sea levels, which in turn permits estimation of the probabilities associated with these extremes.},

  abstract = {Efforts to restore the native oyster in the Chesapeake Bay enjoy enormous public support and have consumed and continue to consume vast, some would argue unreasonable and unjustifiable, amounts of funding. Despite this support the stated goals of restoration efforts are poorly defined and consequently provide no realistic measures of success in terms of time, space, or biomass. Quantitative approaches used successfully in management of and rebuilding plans for other marine and estuarine species have not been appropriately applied. Basic information in oyster population dynamics and ecology has been inadequately appreciated in defining the quantitative problem. Given these limitations it is not surprising that little success has been achieved despite the massive investment. We note a lack of ability to predict recruitment, and limit the ingress and impact of disease. Without control of both of these functions, populations cannot be managed in a self-sustaining rebuilding mode within the footprint that they either currently occupy or formerly occupied. Sustained expansion of that footprint through substrate provision is prohibitively expensive, beyond the limits set by availability of substrate material, and futile in the presence of disease and susceptible oysters. Without attaining a substantially increased and rebuilding population, ecological services will be limited. Water quality impacts will, in reality, be modest, local and seasonal, and still subject to being overwhelmed by periodic storm events. Coherent and rational evaluation of biological limitations will lead to more realistic, and indeed very modest goals for ecological restoration. We must accept the fact that efforts to date to restore native oyster populations have failed and the prognosis for improvement of this situation is continued failure. The argument is proffered that stabilizing the present bed footprint with a realistic and sustainable population and the promotion of aquaculture to increase commercial yield is a more predictable and stable economic investment. Each of these options is consistent with the most realistic ecological outcome and should take priority in future efforts.},

Common flood hazard assessment practices typically account for one driver at a time (e.g., either fluvial flooding only or ocean flooding only), whereas coastal cities vulnerable to SLR are at risk for flooding from multiple drivers (e.g., extreme coastal high tide, storm surge, and river flow). Here, we propose a bivariate flood hazard assessment approach that accounts for compound flooding from river flow and coastal water level, and we show that a univariate approach may not appropriately characterize the flood hazard if there are compounding effects. Using copulas and bivariate dependence analysis, we also quantify the increases in failure probabilities for 2030 and 2050 caused by SLR under representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5. Additionally, the increase in failure probability is shown to be strongly affected by compounding effects. The proposed failure probability method offers an innovative tool for assessing compounding flood hazards in a warming climate.},

The resulting element of discretization for the coupled model is analysed and two different coupling techniques based on mass conservation and mass and momentum conservation respectively are explored, considering both frontal and lateral configurations. The interaction with the boundaries in each model is highlighted and the necessity of using the appropriate strategy according to the flow regime is also justified. The coupled model is tested through academic test cases where the numerical results are compared with a fully 2D model as well as with experimental measurements in steady and unsteady scenarios. It is also applied to a real world configuration, where the flood wave propagation in the river bed is simulated by means of a 1D model and the inundation of the riverside is dealt with a 2D model.

Validation shows that there is good agreement between modelled and observed sea levels, and that the performance of GTSR is similar to that of many regional hydrodynamic models. Due to the limited resolution of the meteorological forcing, extremes are slightly underestimated. This particularly affects tropical cyclones, which requires further research. We foresee applications in assessing flood risk and impacts of climate change. As a first application of GTSR, we estimate that 1.3\% of the global population is exposed to a 1 in 100-year flood.},

  abstract = {The world’s coastal areas are increasingly at risk of coastal flooding due to sea-level rise (SLR). We present a novel global dataset of extreme sea levels, the Coastal Dataset for the Evaluation of Climate Impact (CoDEC), which can be used to accurately map the impact of climate change on coastal regions around the world. The third generation Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM), with a coastal resolution of 2.5 km (1.25 km in Europe), was used to simulate extreme sea levels for the ERA5 climate reanalysis from 1979 to 2017, as well as for future climate scenarios from 2040 to 2100. The validation against observed sea levels demonstrated a good performance, and the annual maxima had a mean bias (MB) of -0.04 m, which is 50\% lower than the MB of the previous GTSR dataset. By the end of the century (2071–2100), it is projected that the 1 in 10-year water levels will have increased 0.34 m on average for RCP4.5, while some locations may experience increases of up to 0.5 m. The change in return levels is largely driven by SLR, although at some locations changes in storms surges and interaction with tides amplify the impact of SLR with changes up to 0.2 m. By presenting an application of the CoDEC dataset to the city of Copenhagen, we demonstrate how climate impact indicators derived from simulation can contribute to an understanding of climate impact on a local scale. Moreover, the CoDEC output locations are designed to be used as boundary conditions for regional models, and we envisage that they will be used for dynamic downscaling.},

  abstract = {Increasing human populations around the global coastline have caused extensive loss, degradation and fragmentation of coastal ecosystems, threatening the delivery of important ecosystem services1. As a result, alarming losses of mangrove, coral reef, seagrass, kelp forest and coastal marsh ecosystems have occurred1–6. However, owing to the difficulty of mapping intertidal areas globally, the distribution and status of tidal flats—one of the most extensive coastal ecosystems—remain unknown7. Here we present an analysis of over 700,000 satellite images that maps~the global extent~of and change in tidal flats over the course of 33 years (1984–2016). We find that tidal flats, defined as sand, rock or mud flats that undergo regular tidal inundation7, occupy at least 127,921~km2 (124,286–131,821~km2, 95\% confidence interval). About 70\% of the global extent of tidal flats is found in three continents (Asia (44\% of total), North America (15.5\% of total) and South America (11\% of total)), with 49.2\% being concentrated in just eight countries (Indonesia, China, Australia, the United States, Canada, India, Brazil and Myanmar). For regions with sufficient data to develop a consistent multi-decadal time series—which included East Asia, the Middle East and North America—we estimate that 16.02\% (15.62–16.47\%, 95\% confidence interval) of tidal flats were lost between 1984 and 2016. Extensive degradation from coastal development1, reduced sediment delivery from major rivers8,9, sinking of riverine deltas8,10, increased coastal erosion and sea-level rise11 signal a continuing negative trajectory for tidal flat ecosystems around the world. Our high-spatial-resolution dataset delivers global maps of tidal flats, which substantially advances our understanding of the distribution, trajectory and status of these poorly known coastal ecosystems.},

It has been suggested that oyster restoration can play an important role in achieving water quality goals in the Bay. An optimal control bioeconomic model is applied to the management of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay, taking into account nutrient removal by the oysters. Optimal management of oyster harvests in the Bay reduces the cost of attaining water quality goals by 4–6\% relative to an open access fishery. A “naïve” management optimization that maximizes discounted net revenues from oyster harvests but that does not take into account their nitrogen impacts performs almost as well as the fully optimal solution. Sensitivity analyses show that the optimal oyster harvest depends on the cost of reducing nitrogen loadings from point and nonpoint sources through best management practices. Further, denitrification by living oysters is a much more important process than nutrient removal through harvest. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

We describe changes in geometry, velocity, and strain rate and present a top-down force balance analysis performed over the lower reach of Columbia Glacier. Our analysis uses new measurements and estimates of basal topography and photogrammetric surface velocity measurements made between 1977 and 2001, while assuming depth-independent strain. Sensitivity tests show that the method is robust and insensitive to small changes in the calculation parameters. Spatial distributions of ice speed show little correspondence with driving stress. Instead, spatial patterns of ice speed exhibit a nonlinear correspondence with basal drag. Primary resistance to flow comes from basal drag, but lateral drag becomes increasingly more important throughout the retreat, which may account for observed increases in speed. Maximum basal drag is always located in a prominent constriction located ∼12 km upstream from the preretreat terminus. Once the terminus retreated into deep water off the terminal moraine marking the modern maximum extent, the upstream location of this maximum basal drag helped to promote thinning and decrease effective pressure in the lower region by limiting replenishing ice flow from upstream. An increase in both ice velocity and calving resulted, initiating what appears to be an irreversible retreat.},

  abstract = {Satisfying the needs of mitigation for losses of habitat and biological resources demands further development of ecological theory to improve quantitative predictions of benefits of ecological restoration projects. Several limitations now exist in scaling compensatory restoration to match losses of ecosystem services. Scaling of restoration projects has historically been done by area of habitat, assuming that function follows. One recent development in compensatory mitigation uses a currency of secondary production, which has the important merit of specifying one measurable, functional goal against which to judge success. Future development of the fundamental basis for restoration ecology might profitably include: (1) identifying and quantifying important ecosystem services to serve as alternative goals of restoration; (2) discriminating among size classes in a population in estimating their contributions to ecosystem services; (3) re-evaluating the practice of restoring the populations of only a few representative or dominant species to replace a diversity of species losses; (4) contrasting the success of habitat restorations vs. population enhancements; (5) incorporating more landscape-scale considerations into ecosystem-based restoration designs; (6) injecting more formal uncertainty analyses into scaling restoration projects; (7) enhancing the basic science of population, community, and ecosystem ecology to improve the capacity of the discipline to predict impacts of interventions; (8) integrating empirical and theoretical developments in food web dynamics to resolve contradictions in our models of how population changes propagate across trophic levels; and (9) incorporating the concept that populations, communities or ecosystems targeted for restoration may now be in alternative states and that restoration targets have been biased by shifting historical baselines. Forging partnerships between the practitioners of ecological restoration and basic ecologists holds a dual promise for testing ecological theory and for improving the effectiveness of environmental restoration.},

Many streams have incised because of changing climate or land-use practices. Because incised streams provide limited benefits to biota, they are a common focus of restoration efforts. Contemporary models of long-term change in streams are focused primarily on physical characteristics, and most restoration efforts are also focused on manipulating physical rather than ecological processes. We present an alternative view, that stream restoration is an ecosystem process, and suggest that the recovery of incised streams is largely dependent on the interaction of biogenic structures with physical fluvial processes. In particular, we propose that live vegetation and beaver dams or beaver dam analogues can substantially accelerate the recovery of incised streams and can help create and maintain complex fluvial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Climate change is increasing the threat of erosion and flooding along coastlines globally. Engineering solutions (e.g. seawalls and breakwaters) in response to protecting coastal communities and associated infrastructure are increasingly becoming economically and ecologically unsustainable. This has led to recommendations to create or restore natural habitats, such as sand dunes, saltmarsh, mangroves, seagrass and kelp beds, and coral and shellfish reefs, to provide coastal protection in place of (or to complement) artificial structures. Coastal managers are frequently faced with the problem of an eroding coastline, which requires a decision on what mitigation options are most appropriate to implement. A barrier to uptake of nature-based coastal defence is stringent evaluation of the effectiveness in comparison to artificial protection structures. Here, we assess the current evidence for the efficacy of nature-based vs. artificial coastal protection and discuss future research needs. Future projects should evaluate habitats created or restored for coastal defence for cost-effectiveness in comparison to an artificial structure under the same environmental conditions. Cost-benefit analyses should take into consideration all ecosystem services provided by nature-based or artificial structures in addition to coastal protection. Interdisciplinary research among scientists, coastal managers and engineers is required to facilitate the experimental trials needed to test the value of these shoreline protection schemes, in order to support their use as alternatives to artificial structures. This research needs to happen now as our rapidly changing climate requires new and innovative solutions to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities to an increasingly uncertain future.},

Root-mean-square error, model vs measured, is 1.0 m w.e. a−1, with r                2 = 0.88. A remarkable result of the analysis was that both precipitation and the factor in the positive degree-day model used to estimate surface ablation were constant with altitude. The model was applied to reconstruct glacier-wide components of surface mass balance over 1948–2007. Surface ablation, 4 km3 ice eq. a−1 (ice equivalent), has changed little throughout the period. From 1948 until about 1981, when drastic retreat began, the surface mass balance was positive but changes in glacier geometry were small, so the positive balance was offset by calving, ∼0.9 km3 ice eq. a−1 . During retreat, volume loss of the glacier accounted for 92\% of the iceberg production. Calving increased to ∼4.3 km3 ice eq. a−1 from 1982 to 1995, and after that until 2007 to ∼8.0 km3 ice eq. a−1, which was about twice the loss by surface ablation, whereas prior to retreat it was only about a quarter as much. Calving is calculated as the difference between glacier-wide surface mass balance and geodetically determined volume change.},

  abstract = {Lay Abstract The Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, often forms intertidal reefs composed of dense assemblages of oysters. Because of their suspension feeding, oysters clear large quantities of particulate matter from the water column, removing not only phytoplankton but also suspended sediment. In addition, because of their metabolic requirements, oysters can utilize substantial quantities of oxygen. An intertidal oyster reef was monitored to quantify processes affecting flow, suspended sediment deposition and erosion, and the exchange of oxygen to and from the reef. At the center of the reef, the flux of oxygen was measured using an eddy-correlation technique, while sediment uptake was computed from the difference between upstream and downstream suspended sediment concentrations across the reef. While the reef was submerged, oxygen uptake increased linearly with velocity, ranging between 100 and 600 mmol m − 2 d − 1. Sediment deposition to the reef also increased linearly for velocities between 0 and 10 cm s − 1. However, for velocities {$>$}15 cm s − 1, sediment uptake by the reef decreased, and at flows {$>$}25 cm s − 1 there was net erosion from the reef due to the resuspension of sediment. Overall, results show that oysters have a net positive effect on water clarity and that water velocities exert a strong influence on the exchange of oxygen and sediment to and from the reef surface.},

  abstract = {Concepts of risk and uncertainty are commonly used for designing and evaluating flood-related hydraulic structures. A general framework for estimating the uncertainty of the return period and risk is presented based on first-order analysis of uncertainty for determining the variance of the return period and risk of failure and the methods of moments, probability weighted moments, and maximum likelihood. The general method is illustrated using the exponential and Gumbel distributions. The derived variance of the return period is a function of the sample size N and the nonexceedance probability q, while that of the risk is function of N, q, and design life n. Simulation experiments were performed to analyze the behavior of the variance of risk for various values of N, q, and n. They showed that the derived variances of the risk can be applicable for a wide range of conditions, particularly for sample sizes bigger than 50 and design lives smaller or equal to 50.

  abstract = {Current practice using probabilistic methods applied for designing hydraulic structures generally assume that extreme events are stationary. However, many studies in the past decades have shown that hydrological records exhibit some type of nonstationarity such as trends and shifts. Human intervention in river basins (e.g., urbanization), the effect of low-frequency climatic variability (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation), and climate change due to increased greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere have been suggested to be the leading causes of changes in the hydrologic cycle of river basins in addition to changes in the magnitude and frequency of extreme floods and extreme sea levels. To tackle nonstationarity in hydrologic extremes, several approaches have been proposed in the literature such as frequency analysis, in which the parameters of a given model vary in accordance with time. The aim of this paper is to show that some basic concepts and methods used in designing flood-related hydraulic structures assuming a stationary world can be extended into a nonstationary framework. In particular, the concepts of return period and risk are formulated by extending the geometric distribution to allow for changing exceeding probabilities over time. Building on previous developments suggested in the statistical and climate change literature, the writers present a simple and unified framework to estimate the return period and risk for nonstationary hydrologic events along with examples and applications so that it can be accessible to a broad audience in the field. The applications demonstrate that the return period and risk estimates for nonstationary situations can be quite different than those corresponding to stationary conditions. They also suggest that the nonstationary analysis can be helpful in making an appropriate assessment of the risk of a hydraulic structure during the planned project-life.

  abstract = {Coastal ecosystem engineers often depend on self-facilitating feedbacks to ameliorate environmental stress. This makes the restoration of such coastal ecosystem engineers difficult. We question if we can increase transplantation success in highly dynamic coastal areas by engineering measures that promote the development of self-facilitating feedback processes. Intertidal blue mussels Mytilus edulis are a typical example of ecosystem engineers that are difficult to restore. A lack of self-facilitating feedbacks at low densities limits establishment success when young mussels are transplanted on dynamic mudflats. In a large field experiment, we investigated the possibility of increasing transplantation success by stimulating the formation of an aggregated spatial configuration in mussels, thereby reducing hydrologically induced dislodgment and the risks of predation. For this, we applied engineering measures in the form of fences that trapped wave dislodged mussels. Mussel loss rates were significantly lower when mussels were placed between both artificial fences, and in high densities (4.2~kg/m2) compared with mussels placed in areas without fences and in low densities (2.1~kg/m2). The fences induced the formation of a banded pattern with high local mussel densities, which locally reduced predation. Synthesis and applications. Our results underline the importance of actively promoting the development of self-facilitating processes, such as aggregation into patterns, in restoration projects of ecosystem engineers. In particular, the current study shows that engineering measures can help to initiate these kinds of self-facilitating interactions, especially in highly dynamic areas. © 2020 British Ecological Society},

  abstract = {Shorelines at the interface of marine, estuarine and terrestrial biomes are among the most degraded and threatened habitats in the coastal zone because of their sensitivity to sea level rise, storms and increased human utilization. Previous efforts to protect shorelines have largely involved constructing bulkheads and seawalls which can detrimentally affect nearshore habitats. Recently, efforts have shifted towards “living shoreline” approaches that include biogenic breakwater reefs. Our study experimentally tested the efficacy of breakwater reefs constructed of oyster shell for protecting eroding coastal shorelines and their effect on nearshore fish and shellfish communities. Along two different stretches of eroding shoreline, we created replicated pairs of subtidal breakwater reefs and established unaltered reference areas as controls. At both sites we measured shoreline and bathymetric change and quantified oyster recruitment, fish and mobile macro-invertebrate abundances. Breakwater reef treatments mitigated shoreline retreat by more than 40\% at one site, but overall vegetation retreat and erosion rates were high across all treatments and at both sites. Oyster settlement and subsequent survival were observed at both sites, with mean adult densities reaching more than eighty oysters m−2 at one site. We found the corridor between intertidal marsh and oyster reef breakwaters supported higher abundances and different communities of fishes than control plots without oyster reef habitat. Among the fishes and mobile invertebrates that appeared to be strongly enhanced were several economically-important species. Blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) were the most clearly enhanced (+297\%) by the presence of breakwater reefs, while red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) (+108\%), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) (+88\%) and flounder (Paralichthys sp.) (+79\%) also benefited. Although the vertical relief of the breakwater reefs was reduced over the course of our study and this compromised the shoreline protection capacity, the observed habitat value demonstrates ecological justification for future, more robust shoreline protection projects.},

  abstract = {Buoyancy input as fresh water exerts a stratifying influence in estuaries and adjacent coastal waters. Predicting the development and breakdown of such stratification is an inherently more difficult problem than that involved in the analogous case of stratification induced by surface heating because the buoyancy input originates at the lateral boundaries. In the approach adopted here, we have adapted the energy considerations used in the surface heating problem to describe the competition between the stabilizing effect of fresh water and the vertical mixing brought about by tidal and wind stirring. Freshwater input induces horizontal gradients which drive the estuarine circulation in which lighter fluid at the surface is moved seaward over heavier fluid moving landward below. This contribution to stratification is expected to vary in time as the level of turbulence varies over the tidal cycle. The density gradient also interacts directly with the vertical shear in the tidal current to induce a periodic input to stratification which is positive on the ebb phase of the tide. Comparison of this input with the available stirring energy leads to a simple criterion for the existence of strain-induced stratification. Observations in a region of Liverpool Bay satisfying this criterion confirm the occurrence of a strong semidiurnal variation in stratification with complete vertical mixing apparent around high water except at neap tides when more permanent stratification may develop. A simulation of the monthly cycle based on a model including straining, stirring, and the estuarine circulation is in qualitative agreement with the main features of the observations.},

Here we present a novel approach assessing the trends in inundation frequency above the National Weather Service’s four flood level categories in 2042 catchments. Results reveal stark regional patterns of changing flood risk that are broadly consistent above the four flood categories. We show that these patterns are dependent on the overall wetness and potential water storage, with fundamental implications for water resources management, agriculture, insurance, navigation, ecology, and populations living in flood-affected areas. Our findings may assist in a better communication of changing flood patterns to a wider audience compared with the more traditional approach of stating trends in terms of discharge magnitudes and frequencies.},

Flow and turbulence over an oyster reef.Simultaneous measurements of near-bed flow and turbulence were collected on opposite banks of an intertidal channel in the North Inlet/Winyah Bay National Estuary Research Reserve. One bank supported an extensive cover of oysters and the other a mixture of sand and mud. The measurements allow comparisons of flow and turbulence characteristics in a similar flow regime but widely varying roughness conditions. Near-bed velocities are higher over the sandbank and occur during the maximum flood portion of the tidal cycle. In contrast, turbulence parameters are higher over the oyster reef, resulting from the presence of the larger roughness elements. Turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stress components increase as a function of flow speed, consistent with equilibrium boundary layer shear flows. For some bursts, the energy spectrum exhibits a −5/3 slope, indicating a defined inertial subrange. Dissipation over the oyster bank is on the order of 10 cm2 s−3 during maximum flood, when the near-bed current speeds are greatest. Drag coefficient and hydraulic roughness are likewise greater over the oyster bank, with average values of CD = 0.025 and z0 = 0.78 cm compared with CD = 0.004 and z0 = 0.02 cm for the sandbank. The analysis reveals a simple roughness formula for oysters in which the physical bottom roughness is equal to 5 times the average height of the oysters.},

  abstract = {Flooding affects more people than any other environmental hazard and hinders sustainable development1,2. Investing in flood adaptation strategies may reduce the loss of life and livelihood caused by floods3. Where and how floods occur and who is exposed are changing as a result of rapid urbanization4, flood mitigation infrastructure5 and increasing settlements in floodplains6. Previous estimates of the global flood-exposed population have been limited by a lack of observational data, relying instead on models, which have high uncertainty3,7–11. Here we use daily satellite imagery at 250-metre resolution to estimate flood extent and population exposure for 913 large flood events from 2000 to 2018. We determine a total inundation area of 2.23 million square kilometres, with 255–290 million people directly affected by floods. We estimate that the total population in locations with satellite-observed inundation grew by 58–86 million from 2000 to 2015. This represents an increase of 20 to 24 per cent in the proportion of the global population exposed to floods, ten times higher than previous estimates7. Climate change projections for 2030 indicate that the proportion of the population exposed to floods will increase further. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the satellite observations will improve our understanding of where floods are changing and how best to adapt. The global flood database generated from these observations will help to improve vulnerability assessments, the accuracy of global and local flood models, the efficacy of adaptation interventions and our understanding of the interactions between landcover change, climate and floods.},

  abstract = {In October of 2004, a 3-d observational program to measure flow and sediment resuspension within a coastal intertidal salt marsh was conducted in the North Inlet/Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve located near Georgetown, South Carolina. Current and acoustic backscatter profiles were obtained from a moored acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) deployed in a shallow tidal channel during the spring phase of the tidal cycle under high discharge conditions. The channel serves as a conduit between Winyah Bay, a large brackish estuary, and North Inlet, a saline intertidal coastal salt marsh with little freshwater input. Salinity measurements indicate that the water column is vertically well mixed during flood, but becomes vertically stratified during early ebb. The stratification results from brackish (15 psu) Winyah Bay water entering North Inlet via the tidal channel, suggesting an exchange mechanism that permits North Inlet to receive a fraction of the poor water quality and high discharge flow from upland rivers. Although maximum flood currents exceed maximum ebb currents by 0.2 m s−1, suspended sediment concentrations are highest during the latter ebb phase and persist for a longer fraction of the ebb cycle. Even though the channel is flood-dominated, the higher concentrations occurring over a longer fraction of the ebb phase indicate net particulate transport from Winyah Bay to North Inlet during spring tide accompanied by high discharge. Our evidence suggests that the higher concentrations during ebb result from increased bed friction caused by flow asymmetries and variations in water depth in which the highest stresses occur near the end of ebb near low water despite stronger maximum currents during flood.},

A review of economic valuation studies reveals that only a few of the goods and services of reefs have been captured. We synthesize current understanding of the relationships between ecological services and functional groups of species and biological communities of coral reefs in different regions of the world. The consequences of human impacts on coral reefs are also discussed, including loss of resilience, or buffer capacity. Such loss may impair the capacity for recovery of coral reefs and as a consequence the quality and quantity of their delivery of ecological goods and services. Conserving the capacity of reefs to generate essential services requires that they are managed as components of a larger seascape-landscape of which human activities are seen as integrated parts.

This trend of undervaluation is partly due to the difficulty involved in placing a monetary value on all relevant factors, but lack of ecological knowledge and a holistic approach among those performing the evaluation may be even more important determinants. This article identifies and synthesizes ecological and biophysical links of mangroves that sustain capture fisheries and aquaculture production. Fish, crustacean and mollusc species associated with mangroves are presented and the ecology of their direct use of this system is reviewed. Through a coastal seascape perspective, biophysical interactions among mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs are illustrated. The life-support functions of mangrove ecosystems also set the framework for sustainable aquaculture in these environments. Estimates of the annual market value of capture fisheries supported by mangroves ranges from US\$750 to 16 750 per hectare, which illustrates the potential support value of mangroves.

  abstract = {A large-scale field experiment was conducted to test whether the physical structure of biogenic reef habitat controls physical conditions (hydrodynamics and hydrographics) with subsequent influence on the performance (recruitment, growth, and survival) of a benthic suspension feeder. The experimental system consisted of restored subtidal oyster reefs inhabited by the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. To determine whether the size of reefs influences the flow environment and oyster performance, reefs of four heights-tall (2 m), short (1 m), dredged (0.6 m), and low (0.1 m)-were constructed at 3-m water depth in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, USA. To test whether oyster performance varies with water depth and hydrographic conditions, tall and short reefs were also constructed at 6-m water depth. Flow speed, sedimentation, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and the performance of oysters were measured as a function of reef height, position on reef, and water depth over a 10-mo period. Flow speed was found to increase on reefs with reef height and elevation on reefs. Rates of sediment deposition were seasonally highest where flow speed was lowest, at the bases of reefs, and seasonally decreased with increasing water depth. More than 90\% of the surface area of low reefs was buried after only 16 mo of exposure in the estuary, indicating that reef height controls habitat quality (and quantity) indirectly through its effect on flow. Short reefs and the bases of tall reefs at 6-m depth were exposed to a total of 26 d of hypoxia/anoxia. No other reef treatment was exposed to ¿5 d of hypoxia. Physical conditions on experimental reefs had a profound influence on the performance of oysters as the flow environment alone explained 81\% of variability in oyster growth and mortality. Recruitment of oysters over a 2-mo period was slightly higher on the front bases than the crests of reefs, but did not vary with reef height or water depth. After 10 mo, the shell growth and condition index of genetically similar, hatchery-raised oysters were greatest on the crests of tall and short reefs, where flow speed and quality of suspended food material were highest, and sediment deposition was lowest. Growth was greatest overall at the crests of tall reefs located at 6-m water depth where flow speed was high, and the numbers of days exposed to hypoxia/anoxia and variation in salinity were lowest. Total percentage mortality of oysters after 10 mo was greater on low reefs located at 3-m depth than on all other reef types and was greater on the bases than crests of tall, short, and dredged reefs. Predation by crabs and fishes accounted for 4-20\% of total oyster mortality and showed no pattern across reef treatments. Results of this experiment indicate (1) that the physical structure and location of biogenic habitat controls local physical variables and (2) that, in turn, physical variables, especially flow speed, have a profound influence on the performance of a resident species. Realization that an ecological function of habitat is to indirectly control local population production through physical-biological coupling should improve our ability to conserve, restore, and manage habitat and associated species diversity. Better ecological engineering of restored oyster reef habitat is likely to improve fishery production and help maintain estuarine biodiversity.},

  abstract = {The spatial proximity of one habitat to another can strongly influence population and community dynamics We investigated whether the proximity of intertidal oyster reefs to vegetated estuarine habitats, salt marshes, and seagrass beds, affects the abundance and community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates on reefs and predator-prey interactions between mobile predators and bivalves living on reefs. Benthic macroinvertebrate abundance was highest on reefs spatially separated from salt marshes. Macroinvertebrate species richness was highest on reefs separated from both salt marshes and seagrass beds. Comparisons of predation on juvenile bivalves transplanted to reefs for 7-12 days indicated that survivorship of clams was greatest on reefs spatially separated from both salt marshes and seagrass beds, whereas reef proximity to vegetated habitats dirt not affect the survivorship of oysters, The foraging behavior of blue crabs may explain patterns of macroinvertebrate abundance and clam survivorship among reefs with different proximity to vegetated habitats. In experiments conducted In 30-m(2) field enclosures, blue crabs had higher predation rates on hard clams transplanted onto artificial reefs adjacent to salt marshes or seagrass beds than on reefs separated from both habitats by unvegetated sand bottom. Thus, vegetated habitats appeared to act as corridors by facilitating the access of blue crabs to oyster reefs and enhancing the intensity of blue crab predation. Such an understanding of the effects of landscape characteristics of estuarine habitats on their value as habitats for estuarine organisms can be used to predict the consequences of habitat fragmentation on ecosystem function and to improve strategies for habitat and species conservation and restoration.},

Using similar habitat choice experiment set-ups in Finland and the USA, the role of food type, habitat complexity and predation hazard on habitat choice of the isopods Idotea baltica (Pallas) and Erichsonella attenuata Harger were tested. When shelter was provided by both living and artificial seagrass, epiphytic food resources on artificial vegetation were clearly preferred by both species, although Idotea was attracted to epiphyte-free seagrass when no alternative food was present. When choosing between food and shelter, both species preferred epiphytic food over shelter. However, under predation hazard of fish, Erichsonella clearly switched to the habitat offering shelter, while the presence of a predatory fish produced no preference for shelter by Idotea. Food type may be considered as an universal mechanism that partly determines the presence of grazers in seagrass habitats and is, in the absence of a predator, more important than shelter. Predation risk affected the behaviour of the grazers, but the response varied between species possibly due to varying importance of fish predation in the areas studied.},

Few studies to substantiate this belief have been conducted in the northeastern United States. This paper examines in detail the life histories and habitat requirements of three species of fish commonly found in salt marshes in the northeastern United States. The results indicate that valuable commercial and recreational species of fish and their prey require coastal wetlands as habitat during their life cycles in New England. Coastal wetland restoration projects will increase the abundance of wetland habitat types required by commercial and recreational species of marine fish. The restoration of the salt marsh within the Galilee Bird Sanctuary in Narragansett, Rhode Island is used as case study. When enhancement of fishery habitat value is a goal of a restoration project, the project should incorporate certain design features. However, the designers of many salt-marsh restoration projects assume that reestablishment of salt-marsh vegetation will result in recolonization by other species of animals.},

  abstract = {The importance of molluscan-dominated systems (e.g., oysters reefs, mussel beds, vermetid gastropods) to the maintenance of commercially and ecologically important species has not been as broadly recognized as has been the importance of other structurally complex estuarine habitats such as sea grass beds and salt marshes. As a consequence, these systems have often been unappreciated and understudied. Important ecosystem services of molluscan-dominated systems include: (1) filtering capacity; (2) benthic-pelagic coupling; (3) creation of refugia from predation; (4) creation of feeding habitat for juvenile and adult mobile species as well as sessile stages of species that attach directly to molluscan shells; and (5) provision of nesting habitat. Destructive harvesting and overfishing can reduce habitat extent and impair habitat functioning. Only recently have ecosystem services been incorporated into the management of these systems. The role of oyster reefs as “essential fish habitat” falls into two principal categories: (1) reefs as habitat for oysters and (2) reefs as habitat for resident and transient species. Although the former role has received some attention as part of efforts to restore oyster resources, the latter role remains largely unexplored. The role of oyster reefs as critical habitat for other species is suggested by the diverse fauna associated with them; however, the factors that control the development of these reef-associated assemblages are generally unknown, and enumeration of specific habitat services using replicated field experiments is just beginning. Using data summarized from studies in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas, we classify finfish assemblages associated with reefs based upon the degree of their association and include an extensive finfish and decapod species list. We conclude, within the context of the current state of knowledge, that (1) the construction of reef bases using materials that provide adequate vertical relief and interstitial space and (2) the establishment of broodstock sanctuaries protected from harvesting pressure are important for restoring oyster populations. Utilization of reef habitats by numerous commercially, recreationally, and ecologically important species across a wide geographic range likely portends the reef habitats' importance as essential fish habitat, but many functional relationships remain to be evaluated. Future oyster habitat research needs include (1) defining the morphological and spatial reef characteristics that support enhanced oyster growth and survival; (2) improving understanding of how harvest methods affect reef integrity and function; (3) determining the critical services provided by reef habitats in the life cycles of important species; and (4) further clarifying the trophic links between the resident fauna on oyster reefs and transient species.},

  abstract = {Most marine habitats are generated by the presence of habitat-modifying species. However, little is know about many aspects of this process, such as how individual- and population-level traits of habitat modifiers affect their ability to reduce environmental stress and thus facilitate other species. An important habitat modifier in New England is the intertidal grass Spartina alterniflora niflora which facilitates the establishment and persistence of cobble beach plant communities by reducing wave-related disturbance. The objectives of this study were to (I) quantify the modification of cobble beach habitats by S. alterniflora, (2) determine how this process is related to S. alterniflora bed traits, and (3) determine why small parches of S. alterniflora generally remain unoccupied by cobble beach plants. Our results demonstrate that S. alterniflora substantially reduces Row-related physical disturbance on cobble beaches. Behind S. alterniflora, mean flow velocity was reduced by 40-60\% and substrate stability was dramatically increased compared to portions of the shoreline not bordered by this species. These comparative results were supported by a S. alterniflora shoot removal experiment, which resulted in a 33\% increase in average flaw velocity and an 85\% increase in substrate instability relative to control areas. There was a strong inverse logarithmic relationship between bed length and both average flow velocity and substrate instability behind S. alterniflora. Most S, alterniflora beds were small and bed length was significantly related to the presence of one or more cobble beach plant species. Only 13\% of beds ¡25 m and 40\% of beds 30-40 m in length were occupied, in contrast to an occupancy rate of 87\% for beds ¿40 m long. Seeds of two annual cobble beach species (Suaeda linearisand Salicornia europaea) were added to plots behind large (¿100 m in length) and small S. alterniflora (¡25 m) beds with and without a substrate stabilization manipulation. Seedlings of both species only emerged and established behind small beds when the substrate was stabilized. These results indicate that smaller S. alterniflora patches are usually unoccupied because they do not stabilize the substrate to a degree that meets the establishment requirements of seedlings. Thus, both habitat modification and facilitation by S, alterniflora are patch-size dependent. The conditionality of this facilitation appears to generate a pattern of patchy yet predictable population and community distribution at a landscape spatial scale.},

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

There are often many possibilities, including restricted permutation or permutation of some form of residuals. This paper provides a summary of recent empirical and theoretical results concerning available methods and gives recommendations for their use in univariate and multivariate applications. The focus of the paper is on complex designs in analysis of variance and multiple regression (i.e., linear models). The assumption of exchangeability required for a permutation test is assured by random allocation of treatments to units in experimental work. For observational data, exchangeability is tantamount to the assumption of independent and identically distributed errors under a null hypothesis. For partial regression, the method of permutation of residuals under a reduced model has been shown to provide the best test. For analysis of variance, one must first identify exchangeable units by considering expected mean squares. Then, one may generally produce either (i) an exact test by restricting permutations or (ii) an approximate test by permuting raw data or some form of residuals. The latter can provide a more powerful test in many situations.},

We argue that restoration ecology has to be an integral component of land management in today's world, and to be broadly applicable, has to have a clearly articulated conceptual basis. This needs to recognize that most ecosystems are dynamic and hence restoration goals cannot be based on static attributes. Setting clear and achievable goals is essential, and these should focus on the desired characteristics for the system in the future, rather than in relation to what these were in the past. Goal setting requires that there is a clear understanding of the restoration options available (and the relative costs of different options). The concept of restoration thresholds suggests that options are determined by the current state of the system in relation to biotic and abiotic thresholds. A further important task is the development of effective and easily measured success criteria. Many parameters could be considered for inclusion in restoration success criteria, but these are often ambiguous or hard to measure. Success criteria need to relate clearly back to specific restoration goals. If restoration ecology is to be successfully practiced as part of humanity's response to continued ecosystem change and degradation, restoration ecologists need to rise to the challenges of meshing science, practice and policy. Restoration ecology is likely to be one of the most important fields of the coming century.},

  abstract = {Estuaries exhibit a wide array of human impacts that can compromise their ecological integrity, because of rapid population growth and uncontrolled development in many coastal regions worldwide. Long-term environmental problems plaguing estuaries require remedial actions to improve the viability and health of these valuable coastal systems. Detailed examination of the effects of pollution inputs, the loss and alteration of estuarine habitat, and the role of other anthropogenic stress indicates that water quality in estuaries, particularly urbanized systems, is often compromised by the overloading of nutrients and organic matter, the influx of pathogens, and the accumulation of chemical contaminants. In addition, the destruction of fringing wetlands and the loss and alteration of estuarine habitats usually degrade biotic communities. Estuaries are characterized by high population densities of microbes, plankton, benthic flora and fauna, and nekton; however, these organisms tend to be highly vulnerable to human activities in coastal watersheds and adjoining embayments. Trends suggest that by 2025 estuaries will be most significantly impacted by habitat loss and alteration associated with a burgeoning coastal population, which is expected to approach six billion people. Habitat destruction has far reaching ecological consequences, modifying the structure, function, and controls of estuarine ecosystems and contributing to the decline of biodiversity. Other anticipated high priority problems are excessive nutrient and sewage inputs to estuaries, principally from land-based sources. These inputs will lead to the greater incidence of eutrophication as well as hypoxia and anoxia. During the next 25 years, overfishing is expected to become a more pervasive and significant anthropogenic factor, also capable of mediating global-scale change to estuaries. Chemical contaminants, notably synthetic organic compounds, will remain a serious problem, especially in heavily industrialized areas. Freshwater diversions appear to be an emerging global problem as the expanding coastal population places greater demands on limited freshwater supplies for agricultural, domestic, and industrial needs. Altered freshwater flows could significantly affect nutrient loads, biotic community structure, and the trophodynamics of estuarine systems. Ecological impacts that will be less threatening, but still damaging, are those caused by introduced species, sea level rise, coastal subsidence, and debris/litter. Although all of these disturbances can alter habitats and contribute to shifts in the composition of estuarine biotic communities, the overall effect will be partial changes to these ecosystem components. Several strategies may mitigate future impacts.},

  abstract = {The vast majority of published papers concerning seagrass meadows contain statements to the effect that seagrass beds serve as important nurseries for many species. We reviewed more than 200 papers that were relevant to the nursery role hypothesis. We used both vote counting and meta-analytic techniques to evaluate whether the body of previous studies that report seagrass meadows to be nursery grounds actually contain data that support this proposition. We restricted our analyses to papers that compared seagrass beds to other habitats, and examined data on a variety of well-studied species concerning their density, growth, survival and migration to adult habitat. Within this group of papers, we considered potential factors that could influence the nursery function (e.g. location, or laboratory vs field studies). We also evaluated case histories of well-documented large-scale seagrass losses on the nursery function. Major results were consistent with the expectations that abundance, growth and survival were greater in seagrass than in unstructured habitats. Abundance data also suggested that seagrass beds in the Northern Hemisphere might be more important as nursery areas than those in the Southern Hemisphere. Surprisingly, few significant differences existed in abundance, growth or survival when seagrass meadows were compared to other structured habitats, such as oyster or cobble reefs, or macroalgal beds. Nor were there decreases in harvests of commercially important species that could clearly be attributed to significant seagrass declines in 3 well-studied areas. However, there were decreased abundances of juveniles of commercially important species in these areas, suggesting a strong link between seagrass abundance and those of juvenile finfish and shellfish. One important implication of these results is that structure per se, rather than the type of structure, appears to be an important determinant of nursery value. Clearly, more rigorous studies that test all aspects of the nursery role hypothesis are clearly needed for seagrass meadows as well as other structured habitats. The results of such studies will allow better decisions to be made concerning the conservation and restoration of marine habitats.},

  abstract = {We reviewed studies providing quantitative measurements of abundance of fishes and large mobile crustaceans on oyster reefs and on nearby sedimentary habitat in the southeast United States. For each species, we compared density by size (age) class on oyster reefs and sedimentary bottom as a means of estimating the degree to which restoration of oyster reef on sedimentary bottom could augment abundances. By applying published information on growth rates of each species and a combination of empirical data and published information on age-specific survivorship, we calculated the per-unit-area enhancement of production of fishes and large mobile crustaceans expected from the addition of oyster reef habitat. For this calculation, we gave the reef habitat full credit for the expected lifetime production of species whose recruitment was judged to be limited by the area of oyster reefs based on nearly exclusive association of recruits to reefs. For species that were only modestly enhanced in abundance by oyster reefs, we gave the reef credit for the fraction of production that is derived from consumption of reef-associated prey, using a combination of gut content data and natural history information. This combination of analyses and calculations revealed that 10 m(2) Of restored oyster reef in the southeast United States is expected to yield an additional 2.6 kg yr(-1) of production of fish and large mobile crustaceans for the functional lifetime of the reef. Because the reef is biogenic and self-sustaining, the lifetime of a reef protected from bottom-disturbing fishing gear is limited by intense storms or sedimentation. A reef lasting 20 to 30 yr would be expected to augment fish and large mobile crustacean production by a cumulative amount of 38 to 50 kg 10 m(-2), discounted to present-day value. This set of calculations assumes that oyster reef habitat now limits production of reef-associated fish and crustaceans in the southeast United States. This assumption seems reasonable based on the tight associations of so many fishes with reef-dependent prey, and the depletion of reef habitat over the past century.},

Degradation of oyster reefs by destructive fishing practices in particular has had a profound effect on estuarine ecology, yet the timing and magnitude of oyster-reef degradation in estuaries is poorly quantified. Here, I evaluate the expansion and collapse of oyster fisheries in 28 estuaries along three continental margins through the analysis of historical proxies derived from fishery records to infer when oyster reefs were degraded. Exploitation for oysters did not occur randomly along continental margins but followed a predictable pattern. Oyster fisheries expanded and collapsed in a linear sequence along eastern North America (Crassostrea virginica), western North America (Ostreola conchaphila), and eastern Australia (Saccostrea glomerata). Fishery collapse began in the estuaries that were nearest to a developing urban center before exploitation began to spread down the coast. As each successive fishery collapsed, oysters from more distant estuaries were fished and transported to restock exploited estuaries near the original urban center. This moving wave of exploitation traveled along each coastline until the most distant estuary had been reached and overfished.},

Understanding this somewhat paradoxical phenomenon requires teasing apart how habitat complexity influences predator-prey dynamics. To determine whether habitat complexity influences predator foraging efficiency, we measured predator foraging rates within structurally simple and complex habitats. We selected as our test system mud crabs feeding on juvenile hard clams within biogenic reefs formed by the eastern oyster. At low and intermediate crab densities, foraging rates of mud crabs were similar between simple and complex habitats. However, at high crab densities foraging rates were higher for crabs in the complex reefs than in the simple reefs. In addition to providing refuge to both intermediate predators and their prey, habitat complexity appears to enhance predator foraging efficiency by reducing interference competition among predators. In systems where interference competition among densely populated predators may be intense, complex habitats may not provide survival benefits to all trophic levels.},

Despite the obvious importance of wave climate on the existence or nonexistence of wetlands along shorelines of water bodies, there are currently few methods for its evaluation at wetland locations. This study used an existing wind-wave hindcast method to estimate wave climate at sites with and without Spartina alterniflora along the shoreline in coastal Alabama. The sites with vegetation along the shoreline had lower wave levels than nearby sites without vegetation. Other sites with eroding stands of vegetation had wave levels intermediate between the no-vegetation and vegetation sites. The upper limit of wave energy for (noneroding) salt marsh existence was a median significant wave height of about H = 0.1 meter and a corresponding 80 percentile (less than this level 80\% of the time) significant wave height of H = 0.2 meter. Sites with less wave energy had vegetation along the shoreline. The results indicate that wave height frequency distribution based on wind-wave modeling hindcasts is an appropriate methodology for wave climate evaluation at wetland sites. The results can be used to minimize the size of breakwaters used in constructed wetlands.},

Typically, shorelines are protected by armoring them with hard, non-native, and nonsustainable materials such as limestone. This study investigated the potential shoreline protection role of created, three-dimensional Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) shell reefs fringing eroding marsh shorelines in Louisiana. Experimental reefs (25 X 1.0 X 0.7 m; intertidal) were created in June 2002 at both high and low wave energy shorelines. Six 25-m study sites (three cultched and three control noncultched) were established at each shoreline in June 2002, for a total of 12 sites. Shoreline retreat was reduced in cultched low-energy shorelines as compared to the control low-energy shorelines (analysis of variance; p ¡ 0.001) but was not significantly different between cultched and noncultched sites in high-energy environments. Spat set increased from 0.5 +/- 0.1 spat/shell in July 2002 to a peak of 9.5 +/- 0.4 spat/shell in October 2002. On average, oyster spat grew at a rate of 0.05 mm/day through the duration of the study. Recruitment and growth rates of oyster spat suggested potential reef sustainability over time. Small fringing reefs may be a useful tool in protecting shorelines in low-energy environments. However, their usefulness may be limited in high-energy environments.},

The results suggest that active habitat selection by postlarvae and young juvenile crabs determines the habitat-specific distribution of juvenile blue crabs, Densities of blue crab settlers (megalopae and first instar crabs) in caged habitat patches were high and similar in artificial seagrass, live shoal grass Halodule wrightii, and live oyster habitats (on average 69 to 82 settlers m(-2)), but significantly lower in mud (26 settlers m(-2)), indicating active selection for any structurally complex habitat at settlement. Second and third instar juvenile blue crabs (J2 and J3 crabs) also colonized the structurally complex habitats in higher numbers (34 to 115 crabs m(-2)), compared to mud (14 crabs m(-2)), demonstrating that young juvenile blue crabs are highly mobile and redistribute soon after metamorphosis. Densities of J2 and J3 blue crabs in uncaged treatments were significantly lower in all habitats than in caged treatments (on average 44\% loss), suggesting high predation mortality. However, the loss of settlers and juvenile crabs was similar in all habitats, and had no significant effect on the juvenile crab distribution. Densities of potential predators were on average 5 times higher in the structurally complex habitats than in mud. An aggregation of predators in the refuge habitats, coupled with a refuge at low prey densities in unstructured habitats, appears to decrease the proximate effect of predation on the distribution of juvenile crabs. Concurrent high settlement of a small xanthid crab (cf. Eurypanopeus sp.) occurred almost exclusively in the oyster habitat, suggesting that species with a limited ability to redistribute after metamorphosis may display a more specific selection of the adult habitat at settlement.},

  abstract = {Efforts to restore the native oyster in the Chesapeake Bay enjoy enormous public support and have consumed and continue to consume vast, some would argue unreasonable and unjustifiable, amounts of funding. Despite this support the stated goals of restoration efforts are poorly defined and consequently provide no realistic measures of success in terms of time, space, or biomass. Quantitative approaches used successfully in management of and rebuilding plans for other marine and estuarine species have not been appropriately applied. Basic information in oyster population dynamics and ecology has been inadequately appreciated in defining the quantitative problem. Given these limitations it is not surprising that little success has been achieved despite the massive investment. We note a lack of ability to predict recruitment, and limit the ingress and impact of disease. Without control of both of these functions, populations cannot be managed in a self-sustaining rebuilding mode within the footprint that they either currently occupy or formerly occupied. Sustained expansion of that footprint through substrate provision is prohibitively expensive, beyond the limits set by availability of substrate material, and futile in the presence of disease and susceptible oysters. Without attaining a substantially increased and rebuilding population, ecological services will be limited. Water quality impacts will, in reality, be modest, local and seasonal, and still subject to being overwhelmed by periodic storm events. Coherent and rational evaluation of biological limitations will lead to more realistic, and indeed very modest goals for ecological restoration. We must accept the fact that efforts to date to restore native oyster populations have failed and the prognosis for improvement of this situation is continued failure. The argument is proffered that stabilizing the present bed footprint with a realistic and sustainable population and the promotion of aquaculture to increase commercial yield is a more predictable and stable economic investment. Each of these options is consistent with the most realistic ecological outcome and should take priority in future efforts.},

We assessed the effects of landscape features on nearshore habitats and biological communities, relating subtidal habitat, shoreline condition, upland land use and nearshore fish communities in a Chesapeake Bay tributary, the James River, Virginia. Both upland development and the placement of erosion control structures on the shoreline were associated with reduced fish community integrity, and shoreline alterations were linked with the amount of subtidal structural habitat in the nearshore. Ecological thresholds in nekton community integrity were evident at ¿= 23\% developed land use within 200 and 1000 m buffer increments. Nekton assemblages at sites with low development (¡ 23\%) and natural or riprap shorelines were different from all other combinations of altered conditions (low development with bulkhead, and high development with riprap or bulkhead). Species composition along natural or riprap revetment shorelines with low upland development tended to be diverse and inclusive of tidal marsh species, while highly developed sites or bulkhead shorelines were dominated by a few generalist species. The complex interaction between watershed (both nearshore and inland) and shoreline development presents a unique challenge for coastal planning. Alternate moderating approaches for coastal development may include preservation of riparian buffers, the placement of living shorelines for erosion control where appropriate, and development of targeting tools to identify landscapes near an ecological threshold.},

This fact, combined with recent recognition of the many ecological services oyster reefs provide to estuarine ecosystems, has resulted in increased efforts to restore and/or enhance the spatial extent of oyster reefs. As part of a large-scale restoration effort in Mobile Bay, Alabama, we designed a field project to determine if the design and location across a bio-physical gradient of restored oyster reefs affect the recruitment of oysters and other sessile invertebrates. In January 2004, eight oyster reefs (325 m(2) each) were constructed in each of three areas of Mobile Bay (Cedar Point, Sand Reef, and Shellbank), which varied in water quality and spatial extent of existing oyster reefs. Four reefs were high relief (¿= 1.0 m vertical relief) and four were high relief (0.1, 0.2 m). Semiannual quadrat surveys and monthly assessments of oyster survivorship were designed to evaluate oyster recruitment, abundance and mortality as a function of reef elevation and location. The two most abundant sessile invertebrartes found in the quadrat sampling were eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and recurved mussel (Ischadium recurvum). Recurved mussels were abundant on all restored reefs, but densities did not significantly vary with location or reef elevation. Oyster recruitment and abundace varied by location (Cedar Point ¿ Sand Reef ¿ Shellbank). Oyster recruitment was also higher on high relief reefs compared with low relief. The pattern of higher recruitment of oysters at high relief reefs suggests that in locations where oyster mortality is high (i.e., Sand Reef) or larval supply is low (i.e.. Shellbank), high relief reefs are an important design element is successful reef restoration.},

Areal coverage of shoreline land cover and SAV for Mobile Bay, Alabama, were combined with information from small-scale biological studies and long-term, large-scale commercial fishery data to model the potential effects of marginal habitat losses on the blue crab fishery. We applied stochastic variation in annual recruitment to the fishery to estimate probabilities for sustainable harvests under scenarios of habitat loss. The simulations suggested that, accumulated over large areas, relatively small local losses of estuarine marsh edge and SAV habitats could have long-term negative effects on the sustainability of the fishery. Spatially extensive models are required to investigate the cumulative ecological effects of many local environmental changes. The requisite scaling adds uncertainty and reduces precision, but if model parameters are accurate at each scale, accurate predictions of long-term outcomes and probabilities are possible.},

We sampled 94 oyster reefs (88 constructed, 6 natural) within 11 no-harvest sanctuaries in estuaries of central and northern North Carolina, USA, to evaluate the success of oyster sanctuaries as a conservation tool. The sanctuaries have been in existence from 3 to 30 yr; 10 sanctuaries protect constructed ('restored') oyster reefs and 1 sanctuary protects natural reefs. Measurements of vertical relief, live oyster density, recruitment, abundance of market-sized oysters, and biomass as well as disease prevalence and severity indicated that 7 of the 11 sanctuaries met criteria for minimal success by having vertical relief ¿20 cm in height, living oysters (¿10 oysters m(-2)), and evidence of recent recruitment in 1. of 2 yr of the survey. Most reefs within the 7 sanctuaries far surpassed these relatively low benchmarks. For reefs that failed, burial by sedimentation appeared to be the primary cause in 2 sanctuaries, poor water quality (low dissolved oxygen) in 1, and poor oyster recruitment in another. All intertidal reefs were successful and had significantly higher densities of all size categories of live oysters (spat, adult, marketable size) than subtidal oyster reefs. Disease prevalence and severity were low in sanctuary reefs despite high oyster densities and increased longevity of oysters on these reefs. Pronouncements that restoration of the native eastern oyster is a failure prove incorrect when a decade-long history of oyster reef sanctuaries is evaluated. The proposed introduction of a non-native oyster into the US Atlantic coast estuaries cannot be justified by claiming failure of native oyster restoration in light of promising successes within sanctuaries.},

  abstract = {The oyster population in the Maryland portion of Chesapeake Bay, USA, has declined by more than 50-fold since the early part of this century. The paper presents evidence that the mechanical destruction of habitat and stock overfishing have been important factors in the decline, even though it is commonly thought that `water quality' and, more recently, oyster diseases are critical. Quantitative analyses show that the long-term decline of oysters largely results from habitat loss associated with intense fishing pressure early in this century, and stock overfishing from early in the century through recent times. Furthermore, the major ecological effects on Chesapeake Bay occurred well before World War II, before industrialization and the reported prevalence of disease. To effect the recovery of the ailing Chesapeake Bay oyster stock, a 4-point management strategy is proposed.},

  abstract = {Oyster cultch was added to the lower intertidal fringe of three created Spartina alterniflora marshes to examine its value in protecting the marsh from erosion. Twelve 5-m-wide plots were established at each site, with six randomly selected plots unaltered (noncultched) and cultch added to the remaining (cultched) plots. Within each cultched plot, cultch was placed along the low tide fringe of the marsh during July 1992, in a band 1.5 m wide by 0.25 m deep. Marsh-edge vegetation stability and sediment erosion were measured for each plot from September 1992 to April 1994. Significant differences (p ¡ 0.05) in marsh-edge vegetation change were detected at the only south-facing site after a major southwester storm. Significantly different rates of sediment erosion and accretion also were observed at this same site. Areas upland of the marsh edge in the cultched areas showed an average accretion of 6.3 cm, while noncultched treatment areas showed an average loss of 3.2 cm. A second site, with northern orientation, also experienced differential sediment accretion and erosion between treatment type, caused instead by boat wakes that were magnified by the abutment of a dredge effluent pipe across the entire front fringe of the site. During this period we observed significant differences in sediment accumulation, with the areas upland of the marsh edge in the cultched treatment having an average accretion of 2.9 cm and the noncultched an average loss of 1.3 cm.},

We have estimated the current economic value of 17 ecosystem services for 16 biomes, based on published studies and a few original calculations. For the entire biosphere, the value (most of which is outside the market) is estimated to be in the range of US\$16-54 trillion (10(12)) per year, with an average of US\$33 trillion per year. Because of the nature of the uncertainties, this must be considered a minimum estimate. Global gross national product total is around US\$18 trillion per year.},

  abstract = {Deep learning methods have recently shown a broad application prospect in rainfall-runoff modeling. However, the lack of physical mechanism becomes a major limitation in using machine learning methods that rely on the available labeled observations. To address this issue, the study proposes that synthetic samples are added to train the deep learning network by using three previously undiscussed physical mechanisms as follows: (1) extreme heavy rainfalls when the soil water is saturated, (2) long-duration rainless events when soil water is exhausted, and (3) the monotonic relationship between rainfall and runoff. A physics-guided Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, shortly named PHY-LSTM, is then formulated. PHY-LSTM network is trained on 531 basins of the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset, indicating that the performance is significantly improved compared to conventional LSTM. Specifically, the mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) improves from 0.52 to 0.61 from the daily simulations during the testing period in local models. It is demonstrated that synthetic samples can effectively improve the simulation of flood peaks and reduce the number of negative streamflow, and strong monotonicity is still maintained even if a slight disturbance is involved in the training dataset. The proposed PHY-LSTM shows that physical mechanisms are very useful to improve efficiencies of the data-driven rainfall-runoff model.},

Chlorophyll-a (the main photosynthetic pigment) is an indicator to estimate phytoplankton biomass in aquatic ecosystems. Similarly, measuring chlorophyll-a concentration allows classifying the aquatic ecosystem based on trophy. Water samples were collected fortnightly from five stations in the wetland. They were collected during summer and autumn (5 months). Results illustrated that there was a significant correlation between chlorophyll-a and Secchi disk (R2=0.650; y=2.852x +192.8) as well as between Secchi disk and water turbidity (R² =0.486; y = -1.865x+82.12) but there was not significant correlation between chlorophyll-a and water turbidity (R²=0.046; y=0.738x +33.10).},
