\begin{enumerate}
    \color{orange}
    \item Start with 2021 OSM coastline
    \item 
    \item clip to extent of mangroves worldwide - only the tropics and subtropics
    \item project in pseudo mercator
    \item split the lines into 100km segments
    \item select these segments where they touch a mangrove 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Processing of Lidar Data}

\section{Gridding of data}
\subsection{temp notes}
Still need to figure out Kalman filter, but based on the current plan one approach might be...
\begin{itemize}
    \color{orange}
    \item download the xyz data that the gebco data is based onboard
    \item download and filter photon locations
    \item correct for tide to put them in MSL
    \item Use the pygmt gridding using the xyz data
    \item how to use satellite gravimetry data in gebco? Need to sort that out
\end{itemize}
