\section{temp notes}
in ocean subsurface return, afterpulse signal can be on the same order of magnitude as the subsurface signal \cite{}

\begin{quote}
    herefore, the ICESat-2 ATLAS after-pulsing effects must first be removed in order to obtain a reliable ocean subsurface profile. A deconvolution method de-scribed in (Lu et al., 2014; Lu, Hu, Vaughan, et al., 2020; Lu, Hu, Yang, et al., 2020) can be used to remove the ICESat-2 ATLAS afterpulses. \citeauthor{Lu2021a}
